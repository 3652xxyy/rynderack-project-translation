# Rynderack Project 2: Eye of Fate - Mission Guide

This part is a guide for clearing the level, please come back to it if you find it difficult.

It is more difficult to clear the level on the highest difficulty (Braindead / Long March) difficulty. All the following tips apply to Braindead / Long March difficulty. There may be better ways to play in Casual and Normal difficulty.

### Translator Note
- Below sections contain **spoilers** to the story. Do not read unless you have to.
- There is no guidance on how to trigger hidden missions in the original document provided by the author. I have noted the approach below based on my own gameplay and some online research.
- The difference between 3 difficulty is significant. More specifically, **Braindead / Long March difficulty is designed such that the author can barely make it without saving/loading**. The author is a very experienced RA2 player. Please keep that in mind.

## Yuri 01 - Victory Day
Difficulty: ★★☆☆☆

This mission is about assisting allies in defense.

In the casual difficulty, even if you do nothing, your allies will help you complete the defense; in the brain-dead difficulty, your allies can delay on the front line for a full 15 minutes without you paying attention, until the enemy starts to send a large number of prism tanks. Only then did the allies' defenses begin to collapse. Therefore, the pace of this level is slow, so don't be too anxious.

Most of the enemies are annihilated by our allies. We only need to help our allies deal with some difficult units - spies, prism tanks and battle fortresses that rush directly into the parade area. At the same time, we must also be careful of snipers who pose a greater threat to our units.

The spy will only touch the orange nuclear power plant in the upper right corner. Place a few Yuri to defend it. Don't throw away the spies you control. You can also cut off the power of your allies later after you turn against them.

Prism tanks are more difficult. You need to wait for an opportunity in the early stage to control some tanks as mobile units to target them in time. You can control the enemy's Grizzly Tank, or you can forcibly control your allies' Rhino Tanks, Tesla Tanks, and Apocalypse Tanks (be careful not to go too far, otherwise there is a danger that your allies' production capacity cannot keep up). The landing force on the left side of the enemy is very suitable for Yuri to control. Use Yuri initiates to occupy a building to deal with the robot tanks, and the rest will become a steady supply of Grizzly Tank for free.

The battle fortress will take a detour and rush towards the parade area in an attempt to crush the parade. It is difficult for allies to deal with them in time and requires a relatively comprehensive defense. Fortunately, the number is small. Use Yuri initiates to occupy buildings + Yuri alternately to build a complete defense line.

To prevent snipers, you can withdraw the defense line behind the allies' defense line, or you can control some IFV to install virus snipers to kill enemy snipers.

After the defense phase is over, there is actually no difficulty because there is unlimited preparation time. First blow up all the production buildings on the orange side, then turn around and use the spies you control to cut off the power on the red side. You can win in one push.

Although there are many enemy units in this level, allies will also provide enough strength, so it is not difficult.


## Yuri 02 - Glee Feast
Difficulty: ★★★☆☆

This is an offensive mission with an interception mechanism. Players need to face the frontal attack of Soviet troops while intercepting escaping transport helicopters and cargo ships.

Invest in mind control technology quickly in early game can turn most of the enemy's land attacks into free money. Three psychic towers at each intersection are basically enough. Pay attention to maintenance at any time. You can send out an appropriate amount of virus snipers, and snipe down low-value infantry first to avoid mind control saturation. It is not recommended to use Lasher tanks + tank bunkers for defense, as it may lead to financial issues. Even on the highest difficulty level, enemies will not use Kirov airships in this level. But you still need to build an appropriate amount of air defense to deal with V3 rockets and armed helicopters (but don't let V3s accumulate indefinitely, remember to clear them out in time, otherwise they will overrun your base eventually).

The two floating discs at the beginning are the main mobile units at the beginning. Rely on them to deal with the enemy's V3 rockets, Dreadnought-class battleships, and chase the escaping helicopters. After battle laboratory, build more floating discs as soon as possible.

The core mechanism of this level is to intercept the enemy's escaping transport helicopters and cargo ships, which requires controlling the upper boundary of the entire map. You can use floating discs to control the map; or you can set up a few mind control towers by the water to attract the enemy's sea scorpions and control 3 to 6 sea scorpions for map control. Using purely floating disc to control the map is very fast paced, but you need to constantly pay attention to whether there are enemies escaping. The speed of the floating disc may not catch up. You can pay attention to the psychic line prompted and use the floating disc to stop on the line in advance; use the sea Scorpion can completely rely on its mobility to control the map, but it needs boomer submarines to help control the water, especially to occupy the exit of the port.

To deal with the airport, it is suggested to use a batch of floating discs to go down the right border of the map and steal them in one wave. It is not recommended to go head-to-head with the base with three cannons in front of you... Of course, if you insist on pushing the whole map, just pretend that I didn't say anything.

The dock can be attacked using boomer submarines, or floating discs. When using floating discs, you need to pay attention to spread out the formation to reduce the area damage of sea scorpions.

The enemies in this level do not incur a high offensive pressure, but the mission objective of constantly monitoring escaping enemy units is very unfriendly to players with poor eyesight. Always scan the upper border of the map to see if there are any psychic lines pointing past it.


## Yuri 03 - Anger of Athena
Difficulty: ★★★★☆

This is a large scale naval battle mission.

In the beginning, a new unit, Yuri Prime, will be introduced, which has faster speed, longer range and levitation ability than ordinary Yuri. Use Yuri to engage the enemy first and let the enemy fleets fight each other. In the port attack stage, you can allow as many floating discs as possible, so you don't have to worry about it. One is that the floating discs will be replenished when they are gone, and the other is that the floating discs will be killed by the plot after a while.

After clearing all the visible areas of the map and deploying the MCV, the map will expand and receive a series of targets, and you can watch your floating disc being completely destroyed by the immobilization field...

Initially occupy the machine shop and oil derricks on the island, and put some Gatling tanks to defend against enemy paratrooper harassment. Watch out for timely kills of enemy snipers, who will drop near the oil derricks and the Parthenon.

The core mechanic of this level is fighting against immobilization fields. During the immobilization field activation, no production or repair can be carried out, the defensive buildings fail, the air force crashes directly, the tanks and submarines cannot move, and only the infantry can barely function. Therefore, the use of floating discs is extremely limited. During the immobilization field, you can only defend but not attack. You need to use boomer submarines (divided into several groups for easy dispatch), Gatling tanks, tank bunkers, magnetron (pull the ships near the shore and throw them away), and Yuri Prime (only lose to snipers on land / catch offshore ships) as soon as possible to build defenses, and produce a large number of boomer submarines as the main force of the attack. It's also important to farm money using Cloning Vats and Genetic Mutators.

Use more than 10 boomer submarines to sneak right above the Origin Technology Laboratory, bomb them with missiles, and turn off the immobilization field, so you can use the floating discs without worrying about your production line being cut off.

The Statue of Victory can be easily dealt with by using boomer submarine bombing. It is recommended to destroy the green base and shipyard before doing this.

For Kraken, you can use a large number of boomer submarines + Yuri Prime + floating discs to attack. First bait a wave of small aircraft carriers, and then Yuri Prime can safely approach and perform mind control. It is also possible to directly use a large number of boomer submarines to kill them.

Among the Titan escorts, the battle fortress has snipers. You can use the mind-controlled Kraken to clear out the snipers, and then use Yuri to mind control; or you can directly use a large number of mind-controlled vehicles.

As long as you use the floating disc to drain the aqua's electricity, the chronosphere will be in vain.

The process of this level is very long and the attack pace is slow, so don't be impatient. The boomer submarine relies on numbers to win, so hold it in a little longer.


## Yuri 04 - Blood Dead
Difficulty: ★★★★☆

This is a limited force micro-management mission. The number of mastermind in the main force is limited and easy to self-destruct. Yuri Prime is powerful but also the target of protection, so they need to be managed carefully.

Two-line operation in the beginning. The upper right mastermind has no need to hurry. You must keep an eye on the defenses near Dracula's Fortress. The controlled tank can be placed near a building to attract enemy magnatrons to reduce damage to the building. Yuri is weak agains virus sniper, so watch out. The attack on Dracula's Fortress will weaken after a while, so we can free up more time to operate the mastermind.

The mastermind is weak against brutes, large number infantries, and magnatrons. Note that after passing under the bridge, you should control as many Gattling tanks as possible and retain them. This is the only way to deal with the brutes; large number of enemy infantry needs to be seduced and destroyed little by little with the mastermind, so do not be impatient; the magnatrons is at this stage. Avoid first.

After the mastermind arrives at the fortress, determine which mastermind the enemy's harriers is focused on, and use that mastermind to guard the home. The rest and Yuri Prime go out to the left and carefully seize the tank factory there, and produce some of your own tanks (pay special attention to the use of Chaos drone), and then go get the barracks and psychic radar directly above the fortress, and you will have a certain production capacity.

Just save money and use the magnatrons to attack and fight your way through. The allies can be ignored. Complete the main escort objective. You can also mind control several prism tanks and level them up. I won’t go into details.

The operation of this level is quite sophasticated. It is easy to lose critical units in the chaos. It is recommended to save game and proceed step by step.


## Yuri 05 - Unstable Alliance
Difficulty: ★★★☆☆

This is a defensive counterattack mission. In the defensive phase, you mainly face attacks from a large number of missiles. After the defense countdown ends, you will get a powerful hero unit - the Eye of Fate.

The core mechanism of this level is to intercept missiles and prevent the rain-like missiles from attacking the psychic dominator. Faced with fast-flying air units like missiles, be sure to build deep air defenses and fix leaks layer by layer. Just surrounding the Psychic Controller with a circle of air defense won't do.

You can try to help the ally's navy to delay as long as possible, allowing the ally's Aegis cruiser to be effective; or use floating discs and a large number of Gattling tanks to create a dispersed layout to create air defense depth. If possible, the Kirov airship can be dealt with in advance with a floating disc, otherwise it will absorb a lot of anti-aircraft firepower that should be used to intercept missiles when it is pressed against your face. In the last 5 minutes, the attack frequency of missiles reaches the maximum. At this time, force field shields can be used as appropriate to increase fault tolerance.

On land, Yuri Prime is a defensive weapon. Together with the virus sniper and the tank bunker that enters the Gattling Tank, it can block almost all attacks on land. The method used by the enemy to install Ivan bombs on demolition truck is effective against psychic tower. Even if you use Yuri Prime to defend, you can't sit back and relax. The controlled demolition truck must be pulled away in time.

The three oil derricks on the upper left can be taken at the beginning. The four on the lower left are not easy to defend after you capture them. You can capture them after the defense is over.

After getting the Eye of Fate, there is basically no difficulty. Just spam the floating disc and cooperate with the Eye of Fate and superweapon to clean up the mess.

In this level, the missiles have a large degree of uncertainity. The insufficient number of air defenses may not be immediately apparent, so it is easy for accidents to happen. The more air defense the better.


## Yuri 06 - The Fall of the Iron Curtain
Difficulty: ★★★★★

This is a fast attack escort mission. Enemies in the Soviet camp have a very strong frontal defense line with the support of multiple Iron Curtains.

The enemy basically does not attack, and only a small number of sporadic troops come to harass, so there is basically no need to defend. Just hold back a wave of attacking troops to penetrate the enemy's defense line within a limited time.

For offensive force, you should use a large number of magnatron, mainly to demolish the enemy's defense towers. It is not recommended to produce a large number of floating discs against the enemy's air defense.

There is no need to rush to high-tech, build 3 to 4 war factories first to spam tanks. Magnetrons, Gattling tanks, Masterminds are all useful. In order to relay troops, you can choose to capture some brown buildings and build war factories there to continue to relay troops.

You can choose to use Yuri Prime instead of a mastermind, or bring some virus snipers to deal with the desolators. However, the poisonous mist produced by the virus sniper can easily injure Yuri Prime by accident, so it is not recommended to mix the two.

We must fight in front of the Eye of Fate, and break out the enemy's iron curtain in front of the Eye of Fate.

In terms of economy, don't forget that there are gems on the lower left, which can be easily mined by slave miners. There are 2 oil derricks in the middle on the right side that can also be taken.

This level combines multiple elements such as spamming units, micro-management, and swift attacks. It can be said to be the pinnacle of difficulty in the Yuri chapter. In order to improve the fault tolerance rate, save more files...


## Yuri 07 - Requiem (Part 1)
Difficulty: ★★★☆☆

This is an offensive mission under a special mechanism. The enemy has two nuclear silos, and forces player to be regularly affected by various negative buffs (disabling radar for 66 seconds, power outage for 66 seconds, and stealing 50% of money).

At the beginning, use the mastermind to go up the mountain from the right side, control and detonate the demolition truck, and then use two floating discs to drain the two anti-aircraft guns at the same time to expand the second base up the mountain.

In order to combat the threat of two nuclear silos, a reasonable building layout needs to be made. Build 2 battle laboratories to prevent the force field shield from being interrupted.

It is better to have a little bit of everything for defenses. In the beginning, the Gattling tank will be used to defeat the Kirov airship. Note that there may be enemy activities on all three levels of cliffs. Using Yuri Prime, Yuri statues and virus snipers as long-range defense is very effective.

The first hacking attack is always to cut off the radar mini-map, and subsequent attacks will be random. You can turn all your spare money into initiates in your free time to reduce the loss of money being transferred away by hackers. After transferring the money, just use the genetic mutation to recycle the money. As the attack deepens, hacker attacks will become more frequent.

The terrain of this level is complex, making it unsuitable for ground based attack, so it is recommended to use the floating disc to attack.

Tianshu must be hiding in the last Soviet construction yard that was destroyed. From this, you can use floating discs to directly rush three bases for a quick attack, but you need to have a sufficient amount of floating discs.

As the final battle of Yuri's chapter, this level is a frontal pressure level. There’s nothing to say, just consume it slowly.


## CN 08 - Requiem (Part 2)
Difficulty: ★☆☆☆☆

This is an investigative individual mission. Missions completed using heroic powers and a small number of auxiliary troops.

Note: The location where Tianshu's body was found is related to the location where Tianshu was killed in Yuri 07 - Requiem (Part 1). If you enter directly from the Chinese mission entrance, then Tianshu's body must be in the nearest base.

Tianquan is a hero with long range and powerful abilities, but iy is fragile and needs to rely on his own speed to get out of danger. As long as you don't rush into the crowd, everything is fine.

There is no difficulty in this level. It’s not difficult.


## CN 09 - Unbelievable Friends
Difficulty: ★★★☆☆

This is a limited force survival + escort mission that involves the micro-management of three high-tech Soviet units: Kirov airships, Apocalypse tanks, and desolators.

The beginning is the micro-management session of the Kirov airship. The Kirov airships form separate formations and use way points to disperse and bomb different targets in order, which can not only reduce the range damage received, but also quickly harvest the enemy. Don't worry about the sea scorpions, allies will help fight them.

After the Apocalypse Tanks and desolators landed, the Kirov airship serve as the vision + path opening function - rushing in front to detect the enemy's situation. Anyway, relying on the large HP of Kirovs, it didn't matter how many times they were hit. The enemy garrison buildings and psychic towers you encounter will basically be dealt with by Kirov airships.

The experience gained before fighting the Iron Curtain should be given priority to the Apocalypse Tank. Note that the Apocalypse Tank with less than half health should be pulled to the back first to recover health. The desolators must advance with the troops to help the Apocalypse Tank clear out the infantry.

The map will be expanded after defeating the Iron Curtain. The next phase of the escort route is probably along the upper border of the map → diagonally downward → along the southern coast close to the airport. In short, it is drawing a circle away from the Dreadnought-class battleships in the middle port. The Kirov airships spread out to clear the way (blow up all obstacles on the road, including civilian buildings), and the remaining troops can gather together and advance slowly. When encountering an enemy Yuri, you need to focus on killing them first. Since Rynderack has obtained the radiation immunity buff in this mission, when surrounded by a large number of infantry, you can consider deploying desolators to the rescue - the Apocalypse Tank's HP is thick enough and can withstand most situations.

This level has a lot of micro-management. Fortunately, all our units in this level can automatically recover health, and there is no clear time limit. As long as the advancement speed is slowed down, the fault tolerance rate can be improved.


## CN 10 - Crazy Gambler
Difficulty: ★★★☆☆

This is a staged fast attack mission. Every time a psychic beacon is destroyed, extra time can be bought.

The 11 psychic beacons can be divided into 6 groups, namely:

- Your side's in the opening: quantity: 1. Use the initial troops to destroy it and obtain the base.
- Allies start: quantity: 1. Located in the middle of the left side of the map. The allies will destroy it when they arrive, so don't worry about it.
- Close to your side: quantity: 3. Use the opening troops to bring 6 to 8 V3 rockets to blow them up. The miners on the upper right can also be used with a rhino tank rush.
- Customs: quantity 1, located in the upper right corner of the map. Use the Rhino tank to charge directly. The defense here is mainly infantry. Use the crushing ability to quickly clear the troops. It is not recommended to use air force to attack, don’t ask me how I know that...
- Close to allies: quantity: 2, located in front of the Grand Lisboa Hotel and the Ruins of St. Paul's. Allies will use Kirov to try to attack these two psychic beacons. Helping allies clear their air defenses can help them win with lower losses.
- Far Point: 3 buildings, destroyed using Dreadnought-class battleships/nuclear missiles/Hind helicopters.
The preparation time for a nuclear missiles is 10 minutes, and every time a psychic beacon is destroyed, the overload time will be extended by 8 minutes (6 minutes after the nuclear silo is built), so it is very stable after the nuclear silo is built. In the early stage, it is the safest way to destroy a few nearby psychic beacons to gain time for the nuclear missile to be launched.

Although the enemy's attacks are few, Rynderack should not be left to fight alone and needs to be properly protected. The Psychic Troops play well in this level, but be aware of the virus snipers.

Try to ignore the enemy's main base before destroying all the psychic beacons. When finishing the attack on the enemy's main base, you can use a large number of V3 rockets to occupy the hilltop on the left side of the enemy's base. You can also pull a MCV over and build a navy in the reservoir on the right...

The enemy in this level is weak in attack and does not need to resist pressure. Although it is a time-limited level, the difficulty is limited to land reclamation. As long as the there is a clear plan, there is no difficulty.


## CN 11 - Eleven Dwarves
Difficulty: ★★★★★

This is a defensive mission with a special mechanism. The more fast neutron reactors defended, the faster the countdown to the remaining time of the defense will pass.

This mission has abundant funds. Under the premise of mining as much as possible in the early stage, start with multiple bases and multiple war factories should be adopted at the beginning, which will help turn funds into combat effectiveness as soon as possible. There will definitely be great benefits if you start with about 3 base vehicles. Build more at your ow discretion.

The main force of defense is a large number of defense towers (defense towers are extremely fast when having multiple bases), psychic troops (using walls to protect from virus sniper attacks, a small amount can greatly enhance the hardness of the position), and anti-aircraft vehicles (mobile air defense, Emergency unit when power being drained), Hind helicopter (mobile unit, used to kill magnetron and V3 rockets), Kirov airship (fixed-point bombing), Apocalypse tank (the elite Apocalypse tank provided is very powerful, please use them wisely). Desolators and nuclear power plants also play a role in auxiliary defense, but it should be noted that desolators and nuclear power plants can only be used in conjunction with defense towers.

Although the enemy has genetic mutators, they can basically be ignored... A small number of infantry are not greatly affected by the mutations, so they can be replenished in time. Use the recruitment center to quickly replenish troops on multiple lines at the same time.

The enemy will advance forward position by position. When a position cannot be defended, it should be decisively abandoned, retreat in an orderly manner and reorganize the defense line. But there are also benefits to being greedy for time: the enemy's attack will continue to strengthen over time. If you can get a higher time multiplier in the early stage and end the battle quickly, you can avoid a hard fight in the later stage.

Nuclear missiles are important for fault tolerance. Once you find that a fast neutron reactor's defenses has been breached and it is too late to destroy it, you can use a nuclear missile to blow it up. It is also feasible to defend the nuclear power plant as a nuclear bomb costing 1,000. The important thing is that this method can be used to kill the occupying engineers in time without destroying the injection device, so as to gain more time.

Attacking the enemy's base is basically futile and yields little profit. You can defend at home with peace of mind, just use money to attack the enemy.

This level is the most difficult frontal pressure level in the game. There’s not much to say, so just go ahead and resist the pressure.


## CN 12 - Dragon Lurk
Difficulty: ★★★★☆

This is a naval combat mission. The escort can be completed after you build up some forces, so that this level can be treated as a regular task.

Whether it is targeting floating discs or boomer missile bombings, air defense is required, so a large amount of air defense needs to be deployed at the beginning to defend. Always pay attention to enemy paratroopers, you can use combat bunkers or garrison buildings to defend key positions. Tianquan also has a good anti-paratrooper effect.

In view of the poor maneuverability of submarines, Dreadnought battleships can be used to bombard boomer submarines that are above the water, and by the way, Dreadnought battleships can also be leveled. After the Dreadnought battleship blows up the Yuri statue, you can push the defense line slightly forward to stagger the attacks of submarines and floating discs, which will be easier to deal with.

You can use a large number of submarines + an appropriate amount of elite Sea Scorpions + Dreadnoughts + battleships (rescued Korean troops) + a small number of Hind helicopters to advance along the waterway. It is basically enough for the shipyard to only replenish submarines. Helicopters are mainly used to explore the Iron Curtain and kill Yuri Prime. After completing the escort mission, you can use the Dreadnoughts to launch a bombing from the rear of the central purple Yuri base, directly destroying the base.

You can also follow the prompts and give priority to using helicopters to seize the airport with Tianquan, where you can mine, send out Black Eagle jets or Iron Curtain demolition trucks to attack the purple Yuri base, beat the enemy until they can no longer resist, and then complete the escort mission. I won’t go into details here. Be aware that the enemy will have ground troops attacking the airport, so pay attention to defense.

The enemy's attack in this level is quite powerful and pervasive, making it difficult for players who are not good at naval combat to deal with it. Fortunately, the enemy's attack method is relatively simple, so it can still be stabilized.


## CN 13 - Mysterious Fire
Difficulty: ★★★★☆

This is a two-front combat mission. The base needs to withstand the pressure from the front while using the two heroes, Rynderack and Tianquan, to advance.

If the control center is not destroyed in time, more and more Titans will be spawned to attack the base, and the pressure on the base will be increasing. Once the base is lost and the radar information is lost, Tianquan will not be able to summon missiles, and the hero side will also lose the means of advancement. Therefore both lines are indispensable.

The base side is mainly defensive. It's recommended to use a large number of Apocalypse tanks (Rhino tanks are easy to kill and suffer heavy losses) supplemented by tesla coils, anti-aircraft guns, psychic troops, etc. You can control some Allied IFVs for maintenance. You can move your defensive position forward to gain more resources, but attempts to attack the enemy's base are basically in vain. In addition to the Titan, you should also be careful of the enemy's Prism Tanks and Mirage Tanks.

Use the heros to advance sideways. It is recommended to clear out the left side of the map first, and then gradually encroach to the right, so that the probability of the missiles summoned by Tianquan being intercepted will be greatly reduced. There is not much support that can be provided by the base side - Hind helicopter (backup, vision), reconnaissance plane, Crazy Ivan (quickly clearing Patriot missiles), and if you have enough money, you can also buy some Kirov airships. The main reason is that these two heroes have comprehensive functions and can completely destroy the enemy. It is only a matter of time. Most resources should also be invested in the defense of the base. Some of the money crates that burst out are difficult to get, so don't take them. It's more important to grab time.

There are two relatively safe oil derricks in the middle of the map, which should be obtained as early as possible. These are important sources of funds during the defensive phase.

After destroying all the control centers, the Titans were paralyzed, allowing the two heroes to return to the base to participate in the advancement. Push the defense line to the front of the Japanese base, use Tianquan to destroy the Patriot missiles and cannons guarding the gate, and then use the Hind helicopter or Kirov airship to directly take out the psychic beacon. It will be much easier to advance after acquiring allied technology. The only thing to pay attention to in the future is not to let the reflection damage of the prism tank destroy the Yuri construction yard. If necessary, it can be protected by the iron curtain.

The two lines of this level are under great pressure and need to be dealt with carefully.


## CN 14 - Stars in the sky
Difficulty: ★★★☆☆

This is the final battle.

In this level, we have all the Soviet technology, including two nuclear silos, but the enemy will also use all of Yuri's offensive methods to counterattack, and also has two psychic dominators.

Don't rush to high-tech in the early stage. First open mines, produce some transitional units and do tower defense. The number of anti-aircraft guns must be sufficient. You can use conscripts to deceive the psychic dominator, but be sure not to let the psychic dominator be used at your base, otherwise the consequences will be severe. Rynderack can become the core of one side's defense, while Tianquan can take the time to bomb the closer enemy defensive positions. Psychic troops also have some use.

After establishing high-tech, build helicopters and nuclear missiles depending on the situation. Nuclear missiles can bomb enemy production buildings. Although the enemy will rebuild, it can effectively reduce defensive pressure. Helicopters should not be sent out too early. You must wait until the defense line is stabilized before going out, because the combat effectiveness of the helicopter is very weak when they are few in number.

The attack can be carried out by using nuclear missiles to open the way and helicopters to finish. Use nuclear missiles to bait the enemy's force shield and severely damage the defending troops. Take advantage of the power outage to use helicopter to deal damage.

When the enemy is defeated, the Eye of Fate will rush directly to your base, seeking a decisive battle. Since the Eye of Fate can control air units and restore health, helicopters should be kept far away, and a large number of anti-aircraft guns should be launched, as well as units protected by the Iron Curtain should be used to attack.

This level is a frontal pressure level of defensive counterattack. It is a bit difficult in the early stage, but it will be easy once the defense line is formed.
