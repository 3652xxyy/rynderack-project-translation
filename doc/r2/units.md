Relevant data and background information for most of the newly added units/buildings/superweapons can be found here.

## Allies

### Titan
Attribute: Hero/Mecha

HP: 2000

Weapons: [Use in order] Thermal Penetration Cannon (against the ground) → Red Arrow Missile → Drain Beam (against buildings and vehicles)

Range: 7 (Thermal Penetration Cannon) / 8 (Red Arrow Missile) / 9 (Drain Beam)

Special effect: Its drain beam weapon will cause damage to enemies along the entire line and restore a large amount of their health.

Mass-produced attributes: CN 13 - Mysterious Fire, the mass-produced model of the Titan that appeared. The damage caused by its beam-absorbing weapon has been weakened, but it has gained immunity to mind control attributes.

Appearances: Yuri 03 - Anger of Athena, Yuri Ex - Mutiny, CN 13 - Mysterious Fire, Skirmish Crates

A heavy combat mech named after the giant in Greek mythology. It is equipped with a number of EU experimental weapon systems, such as the absorption beam, which can instantly absorb the energy and armor of the target and use it to repair its own armor. This gives it unparalleled sustained combat capability. General Wellington is trying to push this type of rack into mass production, but it has not yet been implemented due to the high cost. Its prototype was deployed in Athens.

### Kraken
Attributes: Hero / Levitation

HP: 4000

Weapons: Polarized missiles (for land and water) / "tentacle" cluster torpedoes (for underwater)

Range: 18 (polarizer missiles, minimum range 5) / 14 ("tentacle" cluster torpedo, no minimum range)

Special effect: It attacks more quickly when it locks on the enemy; it has an anti-invisibility vision of 10 distance.

Appearance: Yuri 03 - Anger of Athena, Yuri Ex - Mutiny

A heavy amphibious combat unit named after the sea monster in Norse mythology. It is equipped with four turbine-driven engines, ultra-long-range polarizer missiles, and a cluster torpedo launcher that dominates the deep sea. General Maxwell had never thought of mass-producing this type of combat unit. "As long as we have one, the ocean is ours."

### battleship
Attribute: Ship

HP: 900

Range: 15 (minimum range 1)

Appearance: Yuri 03 - Anger of Athena, Yuri Ex - Mutiny, CN 12 - Dragon Lurk

The previous generation of EU Navy battleships. With the entry of aircraft carriers into service, battleships were swept into the garbage dump of history due to their backwardness in all aspects of attributes, marking the end of the era of "giant ships and heavy artillery". However, in the face of Yuri's imminent threat, all weapons capable of fighting the enemy were activated, including these long-dusted battleships.

### Immobilization Field
Attribute: superweapon

Charging time: 9 minutes

Unleashed Architecture: Origin Tech Labs

Appearance: Yuri 03 - Anger of Athena

An experimental superweapon developed by the European Union. It uses a large-scale  immobilization field to directionally prevent all enemy mechanical power systems from functioning. This super weapon takes effect on the entire battlefield. Once released, it will immediately render all enemy buildings on the battlefield useless, tanks unable to move, and aircraft crashing immediately.

## Soviets

### Rynderack
Attributes: Hero/Infantry

HP: 250

Weapon: Shaped Ray Gun

Range: 9

Special effects: Immune to poison gas and radiation.

Appearances: Yuri 02 - Glee Feast, Yuri 06 - Iron Curtain Befall, CN 02 - Unbelievable Friend, CN 10 - Crazy Gambler, CN 13 - Mysterious Fire, CN 14 - Stars in the Sky

Rynderack is the head of the Soviet Iron Curtain Project and Yuri's archenemy. Previously, Yuri's plan almost succeeded, only because Rynderack activated four Iron Curtain devices in Odessa, led the Black Sea Fleet to break out of the siege, and finally drove Yuri to the moon base, forcing him to activate the time machine. Now that the timeline has been corrected and the time has returned to one year ago, Yuri himself understands that Rynderack has already seen all the plans in his heart.

### Tianshu
Attributes: Hero/Infantry

HP: 200

Weapons: Immobilization Ray (on vehicles) / Hacking (on buildings)

Range: 15 (Immobilization ray) / 2 (Hacking)

Appearance: Yuri 07 - Requiem (Part 1), CN Ex - Broken Red Lotus

Tianshu is a Chinese hacker. Because of his close relationship with the "foreign force" Rynderack and many unauthorized operations, he was distrusted and closely monitored by his superiors. Although he does not carry a firearm on a daily basis, his outstanding hacking skills make him a powerful infiltrator and saboteur on the battlefield.

### Tianquan
Attributes: Hero/Vehicle

HP: 250

Armor: special_2 (anti-infantry weapons and anti-tank weapons will cause effective damage to it)

Weapons: SVD Rifle (for infantry) / Cruise Missile Marker (for vehicles and buildings)

Range: 9 (SVD rifle) / 18 (cruise missile mark)

Number of summons: 6 (no rank, veteran) / 9 (elite)

Loading volume occupied: 2 (Tip: can be loaded into a Hind transport helicopter or anti-aircraft crawler vehicle)

Special effects: Once the summoned cruise missile locks on the attack target, Tianquan does not need to keep locking on the target; cannot be protected by the Iron Curtain, and will be instantly killed by the Iron Curtain; immune to poison gas.

Appearances: CN 08 - Requiem (Part 2), CN 12 - Dragon Lurk, CN 13 - Mysterious Fire, China 14 - Stars in the Sky

Tianquan is a Chinese commando and Tianshu's brother. Unlike his younger brother who loves hacking, he joined the army as a young man and has been serving in the most loyal border guards, engaged in the most dangerous tasks, and he does not have much time to contact his younger brother. Tianquan usually drives a light vehicle to the forefront of the battlefield and uses the rifle in his hand to shoot accurately at the enemy. Although Tianquan himself has difficulty dealing with heavy targets, he has the authority to call for tactical strikes and mark strike positions for cruise missile arrays.

### Maomao
Attributes: Hero/Infantry/Non-Human

HP: 150

Weapon: dog bite

Special effect: Immune to bites from other dogs; can automatically restore life.

Appearance: CN Ex - Broken Red Lotus, and all subsequent missions.

Maomao is Tianshu's dog and his brother's best companion after joining the army, accompanying him through his most unforgettable youth. Maomao is always ready to protect his master, and his superb fighting skills allow him to always have the upper hand in battles against other vicious dogs.

### Sevastopol fortress cannon
Attributes: Landmark Building/Defensive Building

HP: 1200

Range: 25

Appearance: Yuri 02 - Glee Feast

Ancient cannon located in the fortress of Sevastopol, Ukraine. Although it was a very outdated weapon left over from World War II, it was reactivated when Rynderack defended Yuri's attack on the city. Every roar it makes makes the whole city tremble.

### Fast Neutron Reactor
Attribute: Landmark building

HP: 1000

Appearance: CN 11 - Eleven Dwarves

The core facility of the Mianyang Nuclear Research Center in China. These devices can convert depleted uranium containing uranium-238 into nuclear weapons raw material plutonium-239 through a fast neutron breeding reaction. Yuri has coveted these facilities for a long time, but the Chinese are determined not to let them fall into enemy hands.


### Psychic Troops
Attribute: Infantry

HP: 100

Production requirements: Soviet Barracks + Soviet Battle Laboratory

Cost: 1200

Appearance: Yuri 07 - Requiem (Part 1), CN 08 - Requiem (Part 2), CN 10 - Crazy Gambler, and all subsequent missions

Although the unfair trade between China and Yuri has ended, this no longer prevents the Chinese from using some of the psychic technologies they have obtained to train their own psychic troops. It can be said to be "treating others in their own way." Although it will take more time and money due to imperfect technology, it is enough.


### Hind transport helicopter
Attributes: Helicopter/Transport unit

HP: 225

Number of passengers: 3 (loading volume limit: 2)

Production requirements: Soviet Radar + Soviet Tank Factory

Cost: 1200

Special effect: Can slowly self-repair; does not actively attack enemies or counterattack when landing or hovering, but will actively attack when receiving patrol or mobile attack instructions.

Appearances: Yuri 02 - Glee Feast, Yuri 05 - Unstable Alliance, Yuri 07 - Requiem (Part 1), CN 10 - Crazy Gambler, and all subsequent missions.

The Soviets and Chinese used these transport helicopters to drop infantry or lift cargo across terrain. Although it is difficult to carry the airdrop mission of a large number of troops, its simple and practical performance is sufficient for small-scale maneuvers of special forces.

### Recruiting Center
Attributes: Production buildings/resource enhancement

Production requirements: Soviet construction yard + Soviet barracks + Soviet battle laboratory

Cost: 800

Special effect: Each recruitment center increases the cost of infantry by 50%, but the infantry trained in the barracks will be trained in the recruitment center at the same time.

Quantity limit: 3

Appearance: Yuri 07 - Requiem (Part 1), CN 10 - Crazy Gambler, and all subsequent missions

China recruits militiamen to train infantry more quickly. With the full launch of war preparations and the state of "all people as soldiers", the enemies of the Republic will soon fall into the vast ocean of people's war.

Reference data:

1 recruitment center: production speed 200%, total price 150%, unit price 75%.
2 recruitment centers: production speed 300%, total price 225%, unit price 75%.
3 recruitment centers: production speed 400%, total price 337.5%, unit price 84.375%.


### Psychic Sensor
Attributes: Defense Building/Radar

Production requirements: Soviet construction yard + Soviet battle laboratory

Cost: 1000

Special effect: Detect the movement of enemies within a radius of 15 meters.

Appearance: CN Ex - Broken Red Lotus, CN 12 - Dragon Lurk, and all subsequent missions

After replicating the psychic troop technology, the Chinese reconstructed Yuri's psychic sensing technology and used it to detect the movements of Yuri's troops, especially the elusive Boomer attack submarine.

## Yuri

### Yuri Prime
Attributes: Infantry / Amphibious

HP: 150

Weapons: Long range mind control (for infantry and vehicles) / Powerful mind blast (activated when deployed)

Range: 9 (Long range mind control) / 0 (powerful mind blast)

Production requirements: Yuri Barracks + Psychic Radar + Yuri Battle Laboratory

Cost: 1350

Appearance: Yuri 03 - Anger of Athena, and all subsequent missions

Compared to crude clones of Yuri, Yuri Prime is a more accurate copy of Yuri's own psychic powers. Although they are not quite Yuri himself, they can already use psychic power to levitate in the air or control the enemy's mind from a greater distance.

### Yuri statue
Attribute: defensive building

HP: 1200

Weapon: Yuri's Eye

Range: 15

Production requirements: Yuri Construction Yard + Psychic Radar

Cost: 2000

Appearance: Yuri 05 - Unstable Alliance, and all subsequent missions

The towering statue of Yuri is a symbol of Yuri's will. It can use its "gaze" to burn enemies from a distance.

### Eye of Fate
Attributes: Hero / Aircraft

HP: 1600

Weapon: Long range mind control (for infantry and vehicles, can be used against the air) / Ultimate mind blast (for buildings, or directed directly below when deployed)

Range: 9 (Long range mind control) / 3 (ultimate mind blast)

Special effect: Its weapon has 7 level of charge. Each level of charge can be used to quickly release remote mind control or ultimate mind blast, although the recharging is very slow; every time it mind controls an enemy unit, it will recover a considerable amount of health; it can control up to 26 enemy units at the same time.

Boss attributes: CN 14 - Stars in the Sky, the Boss-level Eye of Fate appears. Its health and ultimate mind blast damage have been greatly enhanced. Its charging mechanism is changed to release at fixed intervals. There is no upper limit on the number of units it can mind control.

Appearances: Yuri 05 - Unstable Alliance, Yuri 06 - Fall of the Iron Curtain, CN 14 - Stars in the Sky

The "Eye of Fate" plan came from Yuri's previous failed attempt. The vulnerability of the global mind control network is that it relies too much on fixed buildings - these buildings can be destroyed during the construction process, or have their power cut off during operation. So Yuri decided to build a mobile psychic dominator, which is the "Eye of Fate". Its flying ability uses the same anti-gravity technology as the floating disc, and also uses part of the technology stolen from the Japanese to try to maintain the stability of its spiritual core in the air. In this way, the logistic nightmare of building a psychic dominator in the unstable environment of Arctic glacier can be replaced by something as simple as "let the Eye of Fate fly to the North Pole".
