# Rynderack Project 2: Eye of Fate - Mission Summary

![cover][cover]

## Yuri: Awakening of the Eye of Fate

### YURI 01 - Day of Victory

Location: Leningrad, Soviet Union

![yuri01][yuri01]

Prime Minister Romanov is hosting military parade in Leningrad. All the important figures from the Soviet Union will attend. This is a good opportunity to catch them all.

Control their minds, dominate their will, and make their master happy.

Objective 1: Ensure that the military parade is not disrupted.

Objective 2: Activate the psychic beacon with engineer.

Note: Any friendly or enemy troops entering the parade area will disrupt the parade.

Note: Our goal is to mind control all Soviet senior military officials, please do not destroy the cathedral where they are located.

### YURI 02 - Glee Feast

Location: Sevastopol, Ukraine

![yuri02][yuri02]

We discovered that Rynderack, an elite scientist, escaped our mind control by not participating in the Victory Day parade in Leningrad. All we knew was that he was on vacation in Sevastopol.

Perhaps he noticed something. But he seems to have been trained to resist mind control. He also has powerful Iron Curtain weapons. We should eliminate him quickly.

Objective 1: Destroy all shipyards and sink all cargo ships in the port.

Objective 2: Destroy or capture the airport and destroy all transport helicopters in the port.

Objective 3: Prevent cargo ships or transport helicopter to leave the port.

### YURI 03 - Anger of Athena

Location: Athens, Greece

![yuri03][yuri03]

Our covert operations in Sevastopol alarmed the European Union. Now they view us as a greater threat than the Soviets. Someone must have leaked the intel. There may be a imposter among us.

Regardlessly, Generals Wellington and Maxwell have assembled the largest army in the history of the Allies in Athens, preparing to attack us through Chronosphere.
Take the initiative and demostrate our might!

Objective 1: Clear the landing zone and establish a base.

Objective 2: Destroy the Statue of Victory.

Objective 3: Destroy or mind ontrol the Kraken and Titan.

Objective 4: Destroy the Chronosphere.

Objective 5: Destroy the Origin Technology Laboratory.

Hint: The Immobolization Field will disable our buildings, destroy our air force, disrupt our submarine, immobolize armored units and ships. Only the infantry are unaffected.

### YURI 04 - Blood Deed

Location: Vampire Fortress, Romania

![yuri04][yuri04]

The Psychic Radar detected an abnormality in the master's personal guards in the Romanian fortress. Although the master has been in close contact with us, we are unable to contact the guards.

The worst-case scenario would be that they were bribed by the Allies. We must protect the master at all costs.

Objective 1: Go to Vampire Fortress to provide support.

Objective 2: Escort Yuri Prime to the assembly point.

Objective 3: Keep Yuri Prime alive.

### Yuri Ex - Mutiny

Location: Liverpool, UK

![yuriex][yuriex]

In Yuri 03 - Anger of Athena, you can enter this level by mind-controlling the Titan and Kraken and keeping them alive until the end of the mission.

Objective 1: Destroy the British troops in Liverpool.

Objective 2: Destroy the Soviet troops in Liverpool.

Objective 3: Keep Titan and Kraken alive.

### YURI 05 - Unstable Alliance

Location: Fukui, Japan

![yuri05][yuri05]

We have reached a temporary agreement with Japanese scientists. They will help us create the latest weapon system, the "aerial psychic dominator" - the Eye of Fate, and we will share part of our genetic technology with them.

Of course, we have long been prepared to tear up the agreement. Once the project is completed, we can eliminate them all.

Chinese military has noticed the anomalies in Fukui Port and launched cruise missiles in an attempt to attack our research facilities. We won't let them succeed.

Objective 1: Protect the Psychic Dominator until the development of new technology is completed.

Objective 2: Destroy all hostile forces.

Objective 3: The Eye of Fate cannot be destroyed.

### YURI 06 - Iron Curtain Befall

Location: Novosibirsk, Soviet Union

![yuri06][yuri06]

Rynderack finally showed up. He has assembled a large number of troops in Novosibirsk, trying to intercept the Eye of Fate flying towards the North Pole.

We don't have much time left. To ensure that the Eye of Fate reaches the North Pole on time to connect to the global psychic domination network, it must move forward non-stop.

Rynderack will use Iron Curtain technology to make his defense impenetrable, but we have to go head-to-head with them.

Objective 1: Wait for the Eye of Fate to arrive and assemble an army.

Objective 2: Escort the Eye of Fate through this area.

### YURI 07 - Requiem (Part A)

Location: Brahmaputra Valley, China

![yuri07][yuri07]

The global psychic domination network was disrupted due to a severe cyberattack while trying to launch. All our previous efforts were in vain.

A Chinese hacker, Tianshu, publicly claimed responsibility for the incident. This provocative behavior is not acceptable.

Although our plan has been exposed, Tianshu remains our greatest threat. Get rid of him!

Objective 1: Find and kill Tianshu.

## China: The Dragon's Mighty Blow

### CN 08 - Requiem (Part B)

Location: Brahmaputra Valley, China

![cn08][cn08]

We have lost contact with three military bases in the Brahmaputra Valley. The last we know is that they encountered enemies with unknown strength and numbers.

While it is very dangerous, commando Tianquan volunteered to serve as the vanguard to investigate. According to him, his brother is also in a missing base.

Objective 1: Investigate three missing bases.

Objective 2: Escort Tianquan to the communication center and send out the encrypted message.

### CN 09 - Unbelievable Friend

Location: Vladivostok, Soviet Union

![cn09][cn09]

We are heartbroken over the death of Tianshu. Since he has been dismissed from the intelligence service, he should have little impact on the outcome of the war. We will continue to monitor the movements of Yuri's forces. But at this moment, the Soviet Union, which once took unauthorized military action against Harbin, is our greatest threat.

We will dispatch ground troops to preemptively attack Vladivostok. This will significantly weaken the Soviet naval control of the Far East and ensure our security.

Objective 1: Assault on the Soviet base in Vladivostok.

Objective 2: Escort Rynderack to the airport.

Objective 3: Keep Rynderack alive.

### CN 10 - Crazy Gambler

Location: Macau, China

![cn10][cn10]

Not all cities are as lucky as Harbin. The first batch of psychic beacons we purchased from Yuri were deployed in Macau. They have been activated and controlled part of our army. Rynderack promptly warned us of this.

Fortunately, it will take some time for the psychic beacons to continue to amplify  power and expand control range. This is our chance to destroy Yuri's conspiracy.

Objective 1: Destroy the psychic beacons and rescue the base.

Objective 2: Prevent the psychic beacons from overload.

Objective 3: Eliminate all Yuri forces in Macau.

Hint: Each time a psychic beacon is destroyed, the overload time will be delayed. Once all psychic beacons are destroyed, the overload will cease.

### CN 11 - Eleven Dwarves

Location: Mianyang Nuclear Research Center, China

![cn11][cn11]

Yuri wants to get their hands on our powerful nuclear weapons. Mianyang Nuclear Research Center has been encircled by dozens of times more enemies. Most of our scientists have been evacuated via helicopers, but we don't have time to move the production facility and military. We are in a dire situation!

General Tianziren proposed a bold plan: use fast neutron reactors to produce a large amount of plutonium-239. When enough is produced, create a massive explosion to flatten the entire city along with the enemy.

Objective 1: Protect at least one fast neutron reactor until a sufficient amount of plutonium is enriched.

Objective 2: Prevent Yuri from capturing fast neutron reactor.

Objective 3: Detonate all fast neutron reactors.

Note: Enemies will not attack fast neutron reactor, but they will attempt to capture them. Please destroy them when you can't protect them.

Note: The remaining time will elapse in proportion to the number of reactors on the map.

### China Ex - Broken Red Lotus

Location: Lanzhou, China

![cnex][cnex]

In CN 10 - Crazy Gambler, this level can be entered by never building a nuclear bomb silo.

Objective 1A: Hack into Radar Station A.

Objective 1B: Hack into Radar Station B.

Objective 2: Hack into the psychic beacon.

Objective 3: Let Tianshu reach the evacuation point safely.

Note: The Chinese military uses scheduled security system scans to prevent possible hacker infiltration. Be sure to release all hacked buildings before each security system scan, otherwise the penetration will be exposed.

Hint: Maomao has superb fighting skills, and he always has the upper hand when fighting other vicious dogs.

### CN 12 - Dragon Lurk

Location: Pusan, South Korea

![cn12][cn12]

Based on the information decrypted from the Tianshu's chip, we rushed to Pusan in time and took over some research equipment for the "Final Spirit" project that Yuri had not had time to destroy.

Yuri is not willing to have his plan exposed, and dispatched a large number of naval forces to blockade the Pusan port to prevent us from transporting the equipment out.

We have already transmitted some of the data, but this batch of equipment is still precious and is of great significance to us in deciphering Yuri's conspiracy.

Objective 1: Escort at least one cargo ship to the extraction point.

Objective 2: Destroy Yuri's forces in this area.

Hint: Tianquan can ride on the Hind transport helicopter to be flexible with guided cruise missile in complex terrain.

### CN 13 - Mysterious Fire

Location: Nagoya, Japan

![cn13][cn13]

Our aerial reconnaissance revealed a large number of unusual production facility in Nagoya, Japan. There is evidence that Yuri is mass-producing the Titan, a heavy infantry combat mecha originate from EU, here. It would be a disaster if these powerful weapons were to continuously be produced and sent to all over the world.
Rynderack and Tianquan have arrived in Nagoya. The two parties, who were once suspicious of each other, finally decided to work together.

Objective 1: Destroy all robot control centers.

Objective 2: capture Yuri's construction yard.

Objective 3: Keep Rynderack and Tianquan alive.

Note: Tianquan can mark targets for cruise missiles only when radar information is available.

Hint: Once all robot control centers are destroyed, all Titans will be disabled.

Hint: Neither Rynderack nor Tianquan are able to fight Titans head-on. You may need lots of heavy tanks to fight them.

### CN 14 - Star in the Sky

Location: the North Pole

![cn14][cn14]

Intelligence obtained from Nagoya showed that Yuri was personally piloting the "Eye of Fate" over the North Pole. The "Eye of Fate" is a giant, flying psychic dominator. We know nothing about it except that it is very dangerous.

But in order to end this nightmare, we must do our best.

Objective 1: Destroy the Eye of Fate.
