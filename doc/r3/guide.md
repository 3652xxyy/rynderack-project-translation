# Rynderack Project 3: The Final Spirit - Mission Guide

This part is a guide for clearing each mission, please come back to it if you find it difficult.

All the following tips apply to Broken Wing / Brain Dead difficulty. There may be better ways to play in Casual and Normal difficulty.

### Translator Note
- Below sections contain **spoilers** to the story. Do not read unless you have to.
- The difference between 3 difficulty is significant. More specifically, **Broken Wing / Brain Dead difficulty is designed such that the author can barely make it without saving/loading**. The author is a very experienced RA2 player. Please keep that in mind.

## Difficulty Chart

In this document, the "Difficulty Chart" will be used instead of the previous "Star Rating" to evaluate the difficulty of the mission from multiple dimensions. This evaluation method will more comprehensively reflect the characteristics of the mission, and it will also help players have a clear understanding of their own shortcomings.

<div class="six-axis" width=250 height=250 axis_value="5,4,5,3,4,4" axis_color="rgb(255,100,100)" axis_border_color="rgb(255,0,0)"></div>

The following is an introduction to each dimension:

- **Pressure** - reflects the power differential between the enemy and us. This rating will also increase when the enemy has a fierce attack, or an indestructible defense line, or strong technological suppression.
- **Urgency** - reflects the redundancy left by the time limit or hidden time limit mechanism. When this rating is low, players can leisurely wait for the task to be completed. Otherwise, they must seize the time and develop quickly.
- **Concurrency** - reflects the frequency of switching between multiple fronts. This rating will also increase when the battlefield area is very large, or a single front is very long.
- **Length** - reflects the time required to skillfully complete all mission objectives according to the standard process. The higher the rating, the more likely the player will experience a long and continuous battle.
- **Micro** - reflects the degree of need for micromanagement of units. If you can easily complete the mission by simply building more units, this rating will be lower.
- **Tactics** - reflects the complexity of the tactics required to be implemented. For missions with high ratings, players may need to explore and try many times and execute more complex tactics before they can complete the mission smoothly.

## US 01 - New World

<div class="six-axis" width=250 height=250 axis_value="4,2,2,5,3,2" axis_color="rgb(83,101,255)" axis_border_color="rgb(36,44,111)"></div>

This mission is divided into three phases: assult, defense, and counterattack. It is a warm-up mission.

### Squad assult phase: follow the prompts to advance

You will basically not encounter mind-controlled units in this phase. Make good use of the repair IFVs and try not to lose units. The IFV can be equipped with GI to increase damage. Pay attention to the role of tank destroyers, which is the most resistant tank in this phase.

Regarding the pink base at the bridgehead, you can choose to destroy it quickly if you have enough bandwidth to do so. This will facilitate the subsequent counterattack (i.e., once this base is developed later, it will take a lot of troops to take over it). But if you find that you are unable to destroy it quickly, don't get entangled and just cross the bridge. Capture its production building will cause the purple enemy in the upper right corner to start attacking, which is generally not recommended.

The Boomer submarines are very difficult to handle when crossing the bridge. There is also air defense around the bridge, making it difficult to suppress with the rocketeers obtained after crossing the bridge. The Boomer submarine will lock onto the first target that enters its range. Control the AI targetting and pass it quickly. After crossing the bridge, the rest will not be difficult. Slowly clean up, retake the airport, and enter the defense phase.

### Defense phase: hold the line

There will be 3 groups of Black Eagles, each with 8 aircraft, a total of 24 Black Eager fighters. All enemy Boomer submarines, as well as most of the Masterminds and Magnetrons should be handled by Black Eagles. If you are familiar with the enemy's landing route, you can use Black Eagles to directly sink the enemy's landing craft to prevent them from landing and reduce the pressure on the ground forces. The Navy SEALs can effectively deal with virus snipers by entering the IFV. The rest of the enemies can be intercepted by infantry.

You can also defend with the garrison buildings. At this time, you need to be careful of the Boomer submarines approaching from the north, which will blow up buildings. You need to use Black Eagles  or rocketeers to deal with them in time.

### Counterattack phase: conventional allied attack

The enemy's army attack only comes from one bridge, so you can rest assured if you block the bridgehead. The navy and air force are more difficult to deal with. Air defense is not only to prevent Floating Discs, but also to prevent Boomer's missiles, especially the oil dericks above may be bombed. However, the overall offensive intensity of the enemy is not high, so you can develop with peace of mind.

You can choose build some navy and let the army march along the shore all the way. The advantage of this is that you can take advantage of the long-range attack of the aircraft carrier and the high-quality air defense of the Aegis cruiser.

If the pink base at the bridgehead is not destroyed during the squad assult phase, it is recommended to launch a large number of naval attacks during the counterattack. Use aircraft carriers to blow it up. Then try to build a base at the bridgehead and mine the ores there to solve the economic problem. You can use the Black Eagles to destroy enemy's construction yard in one wave, and then send a large number of prism tanks to clean up the mess.

### Summary: This mission has a lengthy, but the rhythm is not fast and the resources are sufficient, so you can play slowly.

## US 02 - Data Corruption

<div class="six-axis" width=250 height=250 axis_value="3,4,3,3,2,3" axis_color="rgb(83,101,255)" axis_border_color="rgb(36,44,111)"></div>

This is an offensive mission with a complex time limit mechanism. You can choose to launch a brainless frontal attack or a side assult to directly intercept data transmission.

### Frontal attack: Spam Prism tanks to sweep the field

Just follow the prompts to defend the base, then you can pull the MCV to mine in the lower left corner, or go to the oil dericks position indicated in the left middle of the map and extend downward, and then use all the resources to produce prism tanks.

Since the enemies in this mission only have T2 technology, with no Masterminds and Floating Discs, all ground units are fragile. The prism tank group is almost invincible in this mission. As long as they are not approached by Chaos Drones and are not continuously consumed by Magnetrons, a sufficient number of prism tanks can push all the way. In this mission pack, the splash damage of prism tanks to key buildings has been weakened, and you don’t have to worry about the splash damage of prism tanks blowing up the mission target (this should not be considered a weakening, but an enhancement).

The defenses near compute hosts C and D are relatively tight. There are many Chaos Drones near computing host C, so you should move forward carefully step by step. There are many Magnetrons near computing host D, so you should avoid attrition and accumulate a large number of prism tanks to destroy them in one wave.

### Side assult: After airborne interception, interrupt the timer

This approach is mainly for players who have difficulty in advancing from the front, but this requires simutaneous defense at 2 fronts.

Because capturing compute host D will stop the data transmission, which is equivalent to the time limit being cancelled; and there are two oil dericks in the upper right corner of the map. Therefore, if you capture those two oil dericks and develop on the spot, you can use them as a base to directly attack compute hosts C and D, bypassed the compute hosts A and B.

You need to use Black Eagles to clear the air defense on the mountain, and then use Nighthawk helicopters to bring engineers to capture the oil dericks on the upper right. The defense strategy at the oil derick is basically the same as the main base. It is mainly to send infantry to the high ground by helicopter and defend on the high ground. It can also cooperate with some mirage tanks, prism tanks, defense towers, etc.

When attacking, the prism tank is also the main force, but this time the attack distance is very short. You can first destroy the war factory next to compute host D to prevent the enemy from continuing to send troops. The enemy's wall can be used as a cover for the prism tank. This offensive route has plenty of time, and once you capture the computing host D, it is equivalent to no time limit, and you can play slowly later.

### Summary: Although this mission has a time limit, there is plenty of time, and the enemy only has T2 technology. Even so, the pressure of Yuri T2 tech should not be underestimated. It will be a test to your basic skills.

## US 03 - Witness

<div class="six-axis" width=250 height=250 axis_value="3,5,4,3,4,4" axis_color="rgb(83,101,255)" axis_border_color="rgb(36,44,111)"></div>

This is a "push cart" mission. You need to clear the way for Tianquan to move forward. Although Tianquan is not under your control, he will stop when he encounters an enemy. Since Tianquan has a certain self-protection and advancement ability, allies will also help attack, so the only failure condition of this mission is almost always timeout.

The main use case of the new unit **Saratoga Gunship** is "absorbing damage" and "anti-tank". It can easily destroy the Gattling tank under anti-aircraft firepower. It can also rush in front of the Black Eagles to absorb damage (but it is extremely vulnerable to Floating Discs, EXTREMELY). There is no need to build too many Saratoga Gunships, and the main output of the Air Force is still the Black Eagles and Rocketeers.

Since all friendly attacks in this mission are triggered by Tianquan walking to a specific location, you need to seize the rhythm and push Tianquan forward as early as possible in the early stage to obtain friendly support as soon as possible and speed up the rhythm in a snowballing manner. In addition, your initial island and the advancement route are separated by waterways and thus cannot help each other. The resources are also very scarce. If you try to build a large forces on the island before going out, it is basically equivalent to giving up friendly support and taking on all the advancement tasks alone.

The process of pushing the cart in this mission can be roughly divided into three phases:

### The first phase: urban area (left) → outpost: mainly air force suppression

There are not many air defenses in this area, and you can use Saratoga Gunships to aggressively explore the map and destroy patrolling tanks. You can drop paratroopers in the urban area and station them in buildings to assist in the advancement, but remember that paratroopers are not the main force of advancement, so don't waste too much time on them. Use Black Eagles (at least 5 per group, 6 to be safe) to kill the Gattling Cannons one by one until the allies advance to the outpost.

### Phase 2: Port → Pink Base: You can choose to take the opportunity to land, or purely relying on air force to attack.

Note that the two Floating Discs in the port restrict the action of the Saratoga gunship, and you need to use Rocketeers to kill them. The basic tactics of air force advancement are: use the Saratoga gunship to explore the path. Use the Black Eagle/Saratoga gunship to kill all anti-aircraft towers/anti-aircraft vehicles, and the Rocketeers follow up from behind to harvest the remaining ground units. At this stage, you can take the opportunity to land, send a MCV to the position of the outpost on the left and transform into mainly army; if you do not plan to use the army, all the remaining money can be converted into Rocketeers: using Black Eagles + Rocketeers can also complete the subsequent advancement.

### Phase 3: Main Road → Fortress Gate: Allies' help will speeds up the advancement, but the fortress gate still needs help.

Your allies will attack with V3 rockets, Kirov, Hind helicopters and other units. The attack will generally not be counterproductive because of enemy mind control. You can use the base of allies to expand the construction range to transform into the mainly army, and produce prism tanks to advance; or build an airport and transfer the aircraft here, so that the bombing distance is shorter. If you still have enough Black Eagles when you reach the fortress gate, you can charge and replace the Yuri base at the gate, so that you can stop the annoying building reconstruction.

### Operational issues

Generally speaking, the Black Eagles at 4~5 airports are enough. This mission has a slow demand for technology. In the early stage, it is the T2 air force that is fighting, and the battle lab can be delayed. The defense at home can be completed by a large number of (more than 5) Patriot missile towers (this mission is an offensive mission, and the defense line does not need to be impregnable). When you have time, you can spare a plane to counter the Boomer Submarine.

If you want to spam a large number of Rocketeers, it is not enough to rely on the mines on the island. You may also need to mines the island on the right (there will be a radar vision prompt). In the later stage, as the allied navy advances, this island will also be cleared out by the allies, but if you need to seize the rhythm, you can take it first.

### Summary: This mission should be the first discouragement mission in the American chapter... If you don’t have the right idea, you may be confused until the time is up.

## US 04 - Destiny Rhapsody

<div class="six-axis" width=250 height=250 axis_value="3,1,2,5,3,4" axis_color="rgb(83,101,255)" axis_border_color="rgb(36,44,111)"></div>

This is a squad defense and counterattack mission. Due to the rugged mountain roads and the continuous economic tension, you should use elite land forces + air forces to advance, or even use pure air force complete this mission.

This mission unlocks a new unit, the **Storm Chopper**, which is mainly positioned as a mobile air control and AOE anti-infantry. Note: Although a large number of Storm Choppers can easily tear everything apart when facing the enemies of the Allies and Yuri Technology, it's not nearly as effective when the number is insufficient.Therefore, when the economy is tight in the early stage, you should not produce a large number of Storm Choppers. Wouldn't it be better to train a few more elite IFVs? (Although the Storm Chopper is also ridiculously strong after upgrading to elite... For this reason, in the initial squad combat stage, you can distribute the experience as much as possible to the 3 Storm Choppers of the initial troops)

### Titan selection problem: It has a greater impact on the play style of the next mission, but it will not significantly affect the difficulty

- The Titan with damaged thermal cannon (upper left): It has the strongest air defense capability, but the ground capability is significantly weaker, mainly because it loses the ability to fire first. However, since the US chapter lacks land air defense throughout the whole process, I personally think this is the best choice.
- Titan with damaged Red Arrow missile (upper right): air defense capability is useless, and ground firepower output remains basically unchanged. Mirage tank can be retired. It has a magical effect in the next mission, which means that the air force can be used to make the out-of-control Titan run around.
- Titan with damaged drain beam (lower): It has strong firepower, but has lost its self-healing ability, and has become a disabled that must be repaired and followed by IFV. It has a great impact on a certain single-soldier mission (referring to the hidden route of US 07).

### Defense phase: All sides need to be defended, and static lossless defense should be done first

Before destroying the Allied air base, the enemy will randomly drop paratroopers at the four corners of the base, so defense must be done everywhere. It can be solved by using the mobility of Storm Choppers and Rocketeers, as well as the rapid clearing ability of the SEAL IFV.

The enemy's attacking army and air force can be solved by using Mirage Tanks and IFVs respectively. Note: The enemy will also send out gunships to lock our vehicle units, but do not use IFVs to fight against gunships head-on. Use Titan mechas with air defense or Storm Choppers and Rocketeers to solve the problem.

Since the economy of this mission is not enough to support continuous unit spamming, it is necessary to do lossless defense. After the defense is stable, use the elite troops trained during the defense period to attack.

### Offensive phase: The elite ground forces with Titan as the core go out, or the pure air force to solves the problem

The enemy will send out a large number of Floating Discs for attack and patrol. As soon as our troops go out, they will be locked or even chased by the enemy Floating Discs. In the upper half of the map, there will be a situation where they are besieged by more than 8 Floating Discs. Therefore, we must ensure that our air defense capabilities must completely suppress the enemy's air force, so that we can gather fragile light prism tanks or Black Eagles to attack from a long distance. I call this idea "air superiority". Titan with air defense capabilities and Storm Choppers are units that can achieve "air superiority".

You can use Titan to bring prism tanks out, and cooperate with Storm Choppers to assist in air defense for attack; you can also send out a large number of Storm Choppers and cooperate with Black Eagles to attack (if you can seize more airports, this method will be more effective, especially using Black Eagles to directly kill Titan).

### Summary: The pace of this mission is quite slow. As long as you have enough elite troops, it is not difficult to complete the mission, but it poses a big problem for speedrunners.

## US 05 - Tenshukaku

<div class="six-axis" width=250 height=250 axis_value="4,3,5,4,4,5" axis_color="rgb(83,101,255)" axis_border_color="rgb(36,44,111)"></div>

This is a mission with a complex mechanism. You need to protect the Titan that are (almost certainly) mind-controlled by the enemy, establish an effective defense line, and launch an attack at the same time. This means pressure from at least 3 sides.

### Early survival and defense line establishment: clear the survival area as soon as possible and protect the miners

In this mission, you have one of the most luxurious initial troops, including prism tanks, mirage tanks, and Storm Choppers. In the early stage, you must use prism tanks to clean up the surroundings, at least clear out the mining area on the road below, so that you can operate 2 oil dericks + 4 ore drills in the early stage.

Defense needs to be focused on two directions: the highway on the lower left and the mining area below. Mirage tanks should be used as the main defense unit, because when using the Chrono Legionnaires to control the movement of the Titan, the defense line needs to be moved quickly to include the Chrono Legionnaires in the protection range.

If you choose infantry defense, be sure to pay attention to the virus sniper, and use the Storm Chopper and the Rocketeer to kill it in advance.

Chronosphere basically only teleports some basic units, which is not a big threat. The enemy may teleport a demo truck to the mining area below, but the probability is not high and the threat is not great. If you encounter it, it means you have hit the jackpot :(

### Titan handling: It is greatly affected by the choice of the previous mission, but there are corresponding ways to deal with it

The three types of Titan each have their own ways of handling.

- Titan with damaged thermal cannon (upper left): The air force needs to stay away, but it can be safely fixed with the chrono legionnaire (remember to let the chrono legionnaire release the Titan every few minutes and then attack again).
- Titan with damaged red arrow missile (upper right): The chrono legionnaire can easily be killed instantly when approaching, but it can be walked without injury by the Rocketeer. If you want to use the chrono legionnaire to limit its movement, please put the them into the IFV (precautions as above).
- Titan with damaged drain beam (below): Most units cannot get close, but the movement is very elegant, which makes it not easy to be mind-controlled and can delay for a long time.

Note that after all Spiritual Suppression towers are destroyed, if the Titan is still controlled by the enemy, it is necessary to eliminate the enemy unit that controls the Titan in order to regain control.

### Offensive method: Before releasing the Titan, the Black Eagle is the most stable offensive method

Due to the large amount of operations required to handle the complex mechanism and defense of this mission, it is recommended to build 3 airports to replenish Black Eagles, and bomb 7 rounds at all cost to complete the first mission objective. Other offensive methods seem to bring serious concurrency disasters.

After the Titan is released, the pressure drops sharply, and it basically enters the push stage. You can drive a MCV to the lower left moat and open the two mines next to it. You can completely solve the funding problem, and you can send out a large number of prism tanks + Storm Choppers to push the enemy.

When attacking the Tenshukaku, a circle of enemy boomer submarines will suddenly appear from the moat, but it basically only has a frightening effect.

### Summary: In this mission, it seems to be able to shrink in a corner of the map for development, but in fact there are many concurrent lines, and players with weak concurrency skills should try to be conservative.

## US 06 - Century Elegy

<div class="six-axis" width=250 height=250 axis_value="5,3,5,3,4,4" axis_color="rgb(83,101,255)" axis_border_color="rgb(36,44,111)"></div>

This is a purely defensive mission. The key target is at the waterfront, facing direct attack from a large number of enemy heavy bombing fleets. But we can't develop a mature navy, so we must use the air force to control the sea.

### Operation: The most easily overlooked link

Operation is the most easily overlooked link in this mission, but it determines life and death. In the beginning, the mining area we controlled only had two ore drills on the left. Often, player's miners were sneakly destroyed without them realizing that their economy was cut off. After spending all the initial funds, they realized "Why is my money gone"...

In the beginning, you need to produce some miners and protect them as much as possible. The mining area under the slope on the right can be delayed for the time being, unless you can kill the pink landing troops on the right before they land. There are some gems on the lower right, which can be mined first. Since our base is surrounded by enemies at this stage, my suggestion is not to mine farther away for the time being, as it is completely impossible to take care of.

After the arrival of the allies, the threat of the urban area is greatly reduced. You should pull the MCV or produce a large number of miners as soon as possible to mine all the mines on the entire map. This is the basis for the spamming of a large number of aircraft. If you don't have money, you can't afford this noble thing...

### Counterattack the landing troops: Don't invest too much, set aside funds for rapid transformation

The core idea of ​​the first half is "saving", just use the least amount of money to barely defend.

In the beginning, produce some mirage tanks to guard the left mining area and the right gate, cooperate with paratroopers and garrison building to guard the intersection, and Tanya IFV and  Hammer of Freedom for mobile defense.

The extension of the enemy's defense tower on the left is not critical, and you don't need to spend a lot of effort to push it back. When the allies come to attack, it will lose power and the threat will be eliminated. The enemy's landing troops on the left and right need to climb the slope, and the enemy's landing troops do not have units like virus snipers that are extremely threatening to infantry groups. Just use a bunch of infantry to block the slope.

Enemies coming from the city can be effectively consumed by garrison buildings and mirage tanks. If you find that the buildings is being out-ranged, you can pull the air force to rescue. The Hammer of Freedom is very effective in bombing the enemy tanks' assembly points, but don't use it to bomb enemies very close to you, otherwise you may end up with both enemies and friends dying.

The money saved in the early stage is used for the transformation and burst in the later stage. You can quickly drive the MCV all over the map and mine more ores, so that your economy can grow in a snowball-like manner.

Don't try to attack the enemy base below, it will not bring any benefits. (Unless you want to use spies to infiltrate Yuri's battle laboratory)

### Suppress the enemy fleet: Air force! Air force! Air force!

The enemy's offensive fleet in this mission is of extremely high quality. If it is not handled carefully, the combination of a large number of Dreadnought-class battleships, Sea Scorpions, and Boomer Submarines is enough to clear the airspace at sea and bomb all the shore areas. (Sea Scorpions simply shuts down Storm Choppers...) Facing high-quality enemy fleets, basically only air forces with high-burst damage can be used to deal with them in order to get a good combat loss ratio.

Just focus on any type of aircraft, whether it is a Black Eagle, gunship or a Hammer of Freedom. Black Eagles are cheap, so you don't feel bad if they fall, but you may need more of them; Gunships have high HP and unlimited ammunition, but they are slow and you should be careful of being caught by Floating Discs; Hammer of Freedom is powerful and can blow up a large area (hitting Boomer Group), but it has a longer range and is expensive.

Under extreme operation conditions, the uninterrupted operation of Black Eagles at 4 airports can completely suppress the enemy fleet. Even if you can't suppress it, you need to try your best to find a way to destroy the Dreadnought-class battleships and Boomer submarines, and don't let them continue to output crazy on the shore.

### How to deal with the Eye of Fate: The answer has been given to you, it depends on how well you prepare

The game has given a hint that Patriot missiles can effectively deal with the Eye of Fate. But this Patriot missile needs to be prepared a little more in advance, maybe some of it was blown up by the Dreadnought-class battleship before.

There is no need to send Rocketeers and Storm Choppers to fight the Eye of Fate in advance, which will only bring unnecessary losses.

### Fault tolerance: the last resort

The mobile force composed of Storm Choppers and Rocketeers is the last resort. When you have no choice but to pull them up to fight the enemy head-on, you may never be able to form a force of the same size again.

Force field shield is the last fault tolerance measure, but pay attention to the impact of power outage on Patriot missiles. It is generally only used to deal with the last wave of enemy attacks. After the allies have a combat laboratory, they will also try to use force field shield once to protect the satellite communication station below half health.

### Summary: This mission has a high frontal strength, and many details also need to be handled with caution.

## US 07 - Injection (Part A)

<div class="six-axis" width=250 height=250 axis_value="5,2,4,4,3,2" axis_color="rgb(83,101,255)" axis_border_color="rgb(36,44,111)"></div>

This is a relatively conventional defensive counterattack attrition battle. You can choose one from the upper and lower base positions (the upper "army position" and the lower "air force position"), and leave the other to the allies.

### Initial defense of the army position: close combat

The enemy's attack of the army position will be strengthened many times, and it may take 20 minutes to see all the enemy's attack modes. Don't take it lightly before that. An overly simple defense system may suddenly be penetrated by an attack mode that has never appeared before.

There are many ore drills near the army position. Build enough miners to snowball the economy. A good enough economy is the basis to spam units, right? But it is not recommended to take the two oil dericks in the middle too early, because this position will definitely be harassed by the enemy's air force, taking a significant amount of our attention.

The enemy will extend the prism towers to attack, but these tower arrays will be easily solved in front of the prism tank. In fact, after the friendly forces arrive, the two elite prism tanks sent by the reinforcements are enough to relieve your worries.

### Initial defense of the air force position: Build tower & fight for air control

If you choose the air force position, you are in a position that is not connected to the enemy's army, then the pressure of defending the home will be much smaller - right? NO! The air force position will be harassed by the enemy's Floating Discs, Rocketeers, and paratroopers in the early stage. You must quickly build a large number of Patriot missile towers on the right, and then quickly develop the technology to produce the Storm Chopper to fight for air control. If you don't deal with it properly, you may be overwhelmed by a large number of Floating Discs that appear very early.

But that's all you need to do. Once air control is firmly secured, all the air force position needs to think about is how to attack actively. The army position is more about resisting pressure, whereas the air force position needs to be more active.

The air force position lacks ore. It is difficult to continuously produce a large number of aircraft without sufficient money. Therefore, after the arrival of the ally, you can use the construction range of the ally to grab the ally's ore. You can also build a war factory at the ally's position and directly switch to the army. There is no need to elaborate on these.

### Handling of satellite cannons: not very harmful

Soon after the ally arrives, the special mechanism of this mission will be unlocked: Theia Satellite Cannon. Every time an enemy construction plant is destroyed, an additional Theia satellite mark will be generated; after destroying all Yuri construction yards, an additional one will be generated every 15 minutes, with no upper limit. If you really drag it out deliberately, the base will really be a riot of demons...

However, the damage of the Theia satellite cannon to buildings in this mission is very low, and even lower to the construction yard. A small number of satellite cannons can be said to be scraping, and timely repairs can be made; but the damage of satellite cannons to units cannot be ignored, and you need to be careful to avoid them.

### Frontal attack: step by step

You can choose to attack from the front and fight all the way along the main road. The troops are composed of a large number of prism tanks + a small number of mirage tanks + a large number of Storm Choppers, and they push all the way. When encountering a difficult intersection to attack, use the lightning storm to clear the way.

You can also use a large number of Black Eagles or Hammer of Freedom to blow up the enemy's construction yards and production buildings in advance to reduce the obstacles brought by the enemy's reconstruction to the advancement.

### Take the small road to attack: "Ziwu Valley Strategy"

After building a spy satellite, you can observe that there is a valley route in the upper area of the map that leads directly to the north of the enemy's fortress, and there is a permanent radiation zone in the middle of the road. This route can be called the "Ziwu Valley Strategy", and it is a life-and-death journey.

Prism tanks, mirage tanks, and IFVs cannot pass through the radiation zone, but the Titan, as the escort target, and the Allied MCV can pass through! Therefore, we can send the MCV and Titan to the north of the enemy's fortress, where we can set up a base, produce prism tanks to fight the enemy, and finally clear a route to the center of the fortress.

Note that when traveling in the valley, there will almost certainly be enemy gunships and Floating Discs harassing you. There will also be enemy defense towers on both sides of the valley, and enemy mirage tanks ambushing at the exit of the valley. These all need to be dealt with by the air force.

### Summary: This mission is a defensive counterattack war of attrition. As long as you survive the mid-term of attrition, you will definitely see the sun light of the dawn.

## SR 08 - Injection (Part B)

<div class="six-axis" width=250 height=250 axis_value="3,1,2,4,5,2" axis_color="#FFCC33" axis_border_color="#FF9900"></div>

The first and second half of this mission are equivalent to two missions. The underground part is a single hero, and the above ground part is a small position attack and defense.

This mission adds the hero test subject-Delta as a hero of the Psychic Rebellion. Delta has a slow attack speed and a short attack range. It has effective damage to infantry, tanks, and buildings, but is not good at dealing with large numbers of enemies (even a group of mobilized soldiers).Delta's own health is very high, and every attack will release a regenerative aura to restore the health of surrounding it. This allows him to withstand a lot of damage.

Ella is also set as a hero, but in fact she is a virus sniper with double damage (can kill brutes with one shot), increased health and immunity to mind control.

### Underground part: explore each room in turn

There are many routines in the underground part, and you need to explore each room in turn. There is a loop in the room, but for the most part it's linear. Try to use the more tanky Delta to explore the way. Other units need to stick together to prevent being caught. In particular, you need to use the high range of the virus sniper to protect other units.

There are many crates underground, as well as three crates of speed, defense, and firepower. Just fill them up for the troops.

There are 2 rooms in the underground part that are difficult:

- Gene room: The first room to the upper left at the beginning. At this time, you can only operate 2 heroes. You need to quickly destroy the Genetic Mutator while it tries to transform the prisoners to save them. The best result is that the Genetic mutator is destroyed before the first use. Here you need to perform a micro-operation. While fighting the enemy units, blow up the oil barrel on the left from above. Note that you should not approach the Cloning Vat during this process, otherwise the Cloning Vat will send troops much faster.
- Base room: located in the lower right of the room with two tank factories. Once you enter the room, the enemy will start to produce defense towers continuously until they cover the entire room. At this time, you need to concentrate all your forces to destroy the construction yard in one go.
Also, there is an enemy elite virus sniper on the observation deck below the central hall (with poisonous gas and strange patterns in the middle), so be careful to avoid it.

The puzzle of the exit is not difficult at all: clicking on each interaction terminal will reverse the on/off status of the several transmission devices facing it, and it can be solved in a maximum of 3 steps. The transmission device is fully open, and the door lock on the left is open (leading to the second-floor observation deck); the transmission device is fully closed, and the door lock on the right is open (leading to the exit).

### Ground part: build tanks, that's all.

The ground part is relatively conventional. After grabbing the production capacity, use Lasher Light Tanks, Magnatrons, Gattling Tanks + three heroes to attack. Ella's death will not cause the mission to fail, but you should also try to protect her.

You should avoid attacking the village in the upper right corner, because that will cause a direct conflict with the US robot tanks and cause unnecessary losses. When attacking the port, although you and the US military are still in a hostile state, you can still "cooperate" with the US military in to form a two-on-one situation.

### Summary: This mission has a long process, but except for the two time-limited rooms in the underground part, you can play it slowly.

## SR 09 - Reflector

<div class="six-axis" width=250 height=250 axis_value="4,3,1,5,5,3" axis_color="#FFCC33" axis_border_color="#FF9900"></div>

This is a single-unit mission in a chaotic situation. The process is relatively fixed. Just follow the steps step by step. There is plenty of time to choose one of the three bases to take away, and it also provides a certain fault tolerance.

### Infiltrate the Psychic Dominator: advance slowly, don't do unnecessary things

Just walk slowly according to the prompts. Delta is put in front to resist damage, and Rynderack is used to dealt damage to enemy groups. Be careful not to let Rynderack kill Delta.

The more difficult place to fight is near the cliff, where there are Tesla tanks and deployed Siege Choppers. The Tesla tanks should be triggered only when all units are at full health. Concentrate your firepower to deal with it first. Siege Choppers need to be slowly grinded by Rynderack (only he can attack enemies on the cliff).

### Go to the cave entrance: wait for the Soviet army to open the way

After using the Psychic Dominator to destroy the Psychic Beacon, don't rush to the cave entrance, wait for the Soviet army to attack first. During this period, you can do some positive things, such as cleaning up the Magnatrons and Masterminds at the entrance of Yuri's base, but those tank bunkers and Yuri statues should be left for the Soviet army to deal with.

After the Yuri statue on the high ground is destroyed, the two heroes can try to cross the road and wait in the upper left corner of the mining area, which is a relatively safe position. Then, while the Soviet army breaks through the defense, you can open the cliff to the cave entrance.

### Seize Base A: Snatch Food from the Tiger's Mouth

The biggest difficulty in seizing Base A is: by the time you can seize this base, the Soviet army has already broken through the defense and will soon destroy the base, so it is called "snatching food from the tiger's mouth." When taking this base, you must act fast, and rush forward in one go when the front line of defense is torn apart.

In addition, there will be virus snipers squatting on the mountain in the upper right corner of the base, and they need to be killed in advance to ensure the safety of the engineers.

### Seizing Base B: Looking down from a high position

Seizing Base B requires ensuring that it cannot be delayed in the early stage, otherwise it will be targeted by the Soviet tanks covered with iron curtains, and then it will be really unsolvable.

Before seizing Base B, you can first capture the barracks in the upper right corner of the map, build some engineers and Yuri clones, and mind control two Magnatrons. Then climb up the hill on the upper right of Base B and clear the defenses below from a high position.

When the defense is almost cleared, you can go to capture it. Note that the engineer must be close to the edge throughout the capture process, avoiding the two Yuri statues in the center of the position (what? You said to wait for the Soviet army to demolish it? It seems a bit dangerous, and it may turn into a snatch food from tiger's mouth).

### Seizing Base C: Avoid the front and attack the side

Don't try to attack Base C head-on, just hit it from its lower right corner.

To capture this base, you also needs to avoid Soviet interference, and it is best to leave the Soviets far behind. As long as the Soviets don't chase too closely, it is still possible to use the Magnatron and two heroes to slowly clean up. The countdown limit in the lower right corner is looser than the Soviet attack.

### Escape phase: Just run away

After grabbing the base, you don't need to worry about anything else, just run with the whole team. Remember to keep an engineer. There is a bridge near the evacuation point that can be repaired to make the escape easy.

### Summary: The process of this mission is fixed, but there are many micro-operations, and most of the time it focuses on "avoiding combat" rather than confronting the enemy head-on. It may take some time to understand this idea.

## SR 10 - Brainwave Overload

<div class="six-axis" width=250 height=250 axis_value="5,4,3,3,4,4" axis_color="#FFCC33" axis_border_color="#FF9900"></div>

This is a fast attack mission. You have a technological advantage at first, but the enemy will become stronger and stronger as time goes by. If you don't advance quickly, there will be no chance to advance.

This mission adds a new unit, the **Chaos Troops**, which has an attack effect that is roughly a Chaos Drone, and also has a certain attack power against buildings. Chaos technology is not as reliable as mind control technology, but it can deal with enemy units that have been mind-controlled.

### Seizing the base: done in one go

When you get close to the US base, there will be a hint on the small map. Just rush in from the right side of the base close to the water. Pay attention to using the Mastermind to protect the engineer from the SEAL IFV, and pay attention to the dog when charging. You only need to capture the construction yard, and you don’t need to think about what will happen after capturing it, so you can just charge in a desperate wave.

### Initial operation: race against time

The initial operation needs to be as fast as possible. Especially the air force base opposite the park needs to be rushed as soon as possible, because that base will not stop disturbing your mining. You can use an airplane to blow up the Psychic Beacon directly, or use Prism Tanks to rush.

The mining area in the upper left corner needs to be replenished with a refinary; the mining area in the center of the park can also be mined, but it is best to use a slave miner.

The richest resource area in this mission is located in the upper middle of the map, with a bank (equivalent to 4 oil dericks) and 2 ore drills. If you have spare power, you can attack here. This is the most suitable place to use air force attacks, and it can be easily taken down using gunships and hammers of freedom.

The enemy will send out units with permanent mind control auras to attack. These units are completely immune to mind control, which makes the mind control tower defense ineffective (besides, the enemy still has a large number of brutes). You can destroy the Psychic Dominator in the middle of the left side of the map to prevent the enemy from having permanent mind control auras; you can also use the control effects of chaos troops or Magnatrons to defend.

### Land attack: head-on

For land attack, you needs to use the technological advantages of prism tanks + tank bunkers + Magnatrons + Masterminds to force a breakthrough as soon as possible. You can drive a MCV to the front of the enemy's core position, then extend forward and build a tank bunker, and insert a prism tank to attack.

The technological advantage of the army will be gradually diluted by the enemy's buff advantage, so the land attack must be fast! Speed ​​is everything!!!

### Air attack: the last solution

In fact, this mission can be passed by destroying the 6 buildings in the enemy's core area, so it is natural to think of using air force (Black Eagles or Hammer of Freedom) to bomb. The enemy's buildings will not become more difficult to bomb over time, which makes the air force the last resort as time goes by. But in order to bomb smoothly, some preparations are needed.

On the one hand, sufficient funds are needed to build a sufficient number of aircraft; on the other hand, a closer airport position makes the round trip of the aircraft shorter (Even if you don't plan to "return"... that will still have a big impact). The Psychic Beacon on the far left is a good location.

### Summary: Although there are dual technologies of the Allied Forces + Yuri, if you delay in time, the frontal strength of this mission is extremely high, so you still have to attack quickly.

## SR 11 - Tide Watcher

<div class="six-axis" width=250 height=250 axis_value="5,4,4,4,3,3" axis_color="#FFCC33" axis_border_color="#FF9900"></div>

This is a defensive counterattack mission. After completing the defensive steps, the allies will launch a large-scale landing and completely reverse the situation.

### Destroy the spy satellite: Infantry-based

After landing, deploy the base and start production quickly. There is no need to attack without production.

There is a hospital on the upper right of the island, and there are few anti-infantry units in the enemy base, which allows infantry to become the main force in the first phase, especially the Brutes and psychic commandos who are immune to mind-control. A large number of Brutes can directly smash through this Yuri base.

Note that you should try to save money in the first phase and save more funds for the second phase of defense. Try to grab the base above. On the premise of ensuring that you can complete the goal of destroying the spy satellite in time, you can try to delay to save time for development.

### Defense phase: full air defense

The second phase requires full effort for air defense. You will see the most intense air raid in the entire Rynderack series, which almost burn the entire Coronado Island to the ground.

It is possible to use Floating Discs, Gattling cannons or a Gattling tanks in the tank bunker as the main air defense, but they all have weaknesses. The Floating Discs needs to be careful of the Aegis cruisers cruising on the sea, worry about the enemy's Storm Choppers, and the Floating Discs' production capacity is not enough. Gattling tank will be constantly replaced by the enemy's aircraft, and the war attrition is huge. There is no comfortable way to pass the defense phase, but just force it through.

You can build a large number of junk buildings (such as docks, empty tank bunkers) to deceive the enemy's air strikes, which is also a way of thinking.

When there are about 10 minutes left, you need to face a large wave of attacks from the enemy with the Kraken, and this time you can't use mind control to solve it. You can use its minimum range to get close to the Floating Discs or the Brutes to destroy it. You can also use the Magnatron to smash it on the cliff.

Almost nobody can escape intact from the violent air strike in the last 3 minutes. It is necessary to pay attention to preserve a certain amount of air defense in this wave of air strikes, as long as you can defend the subsequent Rocketeers who come to finish it off.

### Counterattack phase: Allies are very reliable

After the allies land, you will regain the base and initial funds. You can choose to continue to develop on the island, so that the allies can have more space, or you can also move your base to the allies, so that you don’t have to defend the base, but the allies will also fight slower.

As long as you can defend the base, the allies can attack and take down all enemies. The order of attack focus of the allies is: the Allied Air Force Base (light purple) closest to the allies → the Allied Naval Base (pink) on the right → the Yuri Base (purple) in the upper right corner of the map. Attacking with allies is more efficient.

The offensive unit should be mainly a large number of Floating Discs, and that's all. When using Floating Discs to attack the Allied Naval Base (pink), you can suppress the location of its airport, which makes naval assult more effective.

### Summary: The difficulty of this mission is almost concentrated in the defense link. Once the allies land, the balance of victory will tilt towards us.

## SR 12 - Destiny Cadence

<div class="six-axis" width=250 height=250 axis_value="5,1,1,5,4,3" axis_color="#FFCC33" axis_border_color="#FF9900"></div>

This is a single-soldier frontal breakthrough mission.

The enemy base in this mission is huge, but the pace is very slow. There is no mission mechanism to force you to advance as soon as possible, so you can play slowly and be patient. As long as you don’t take risks, you won’t overturn.

### Infiltration phase: a small detour

The route of the infiltration phase is very clear: the spy follows the left side of the map, takes the cliff gap to meet Ella (Simon cannot pass at this time); then Ella uses the range advantage to cover the spy to take the road above the position of the Eye of Fate, and the infiltration is successful.

There are Yuri clone and Yuri prime everywhere on the route, but note that Ella and Simon, as "hero" units, are immune to mind control. They need to cooperate to clear obstacles in advance. When the spy crosses the road, be careful not to be crushed by patrolling tanks.

### Panel operation phase: free combination according to needs

The panel operation phase is actually a "battle that takes place in the sidebar" - all five transmission circuits ABCDE must be cracked, and as many advantagous options as possible must be selected before the Eye of Fate is forced to take off; but the enemy will also try to lock the circuit in a random order, and each circuit must be cracked before being locked by the enemy.

The effects of all the buff options are listed below:

- Create Power Failure (takes 20 seconds): After the Eye of Fate is launched, the purple base on the right and the pink base above will be out of power for 3 minutes (Note: using spies to steal power during a power outage will cause the power outage time to be reset to 1 minute and 6 seconds, not the increase the time).
- Combat Data Entry (takes 20 seconds): The Eye of Fate is initially launched in a elite state.
- Initial Fund Archive (takes 40 seconds): After the Eye of Fate is launched, 50,000 gold is obtained.
- Enable Sensor Module (takes 40 seconds): When the Eye of Fate is launched, it gains the psychic sensing support skill.
- Mastermind Awakening (takes 60 seconds): When the Eye of Fate is launched, it gains the super weapon "Psychic Dominator" (cooling time 10 minutes, control range 5×5, one circle larger than the original Psychic Dominator range).
- Fate Planning (60 seconds): When the Eye of Fate is launched, you will get the super weapon "Super Luck" (10 minutes of cooling time. After release, the Eye of Fate will recover its durability at a high speed for a period of time, which can be considered as short-term invincibility + full health).

The two 20-second options - "Creating Power Failure" and "Combat Data Entry" are mainly used for early transition, helping you to open up the situation faster in the early stage. "Creating Power Failure" can help you take the purple Yuri base on the right in one wave if used well, but if you don't have a clear tactical design, you should prefer "Combat Data Entry" to enjoy the better defense brought by elite status.

The two 40-second options - "Initial Fund Archive" and "Enable Sensor Module" are mainly used for mid-term development. However, if you don't plan to obtain production buildings throughout the whole process (this mission does not require any production buildings to spam a large number of troops), or you are particularly familiar with the map and do not need additional vision support, the role of the corresponding options will be greatly reduced.

The two 60-second gain options - "Mastermind Awakening" and "Fate Planning" are actually two big skills. Generally, you must take one of the two to ensure the efficiency of advancement, or you can take both. Generally speaking, the effect brought by "Super Luck" is more powerful; but if you do not intend to put the Eye of Fate in danger throughout the process and want to make a more conservative choice, then the "Psychic Dominator" has more opportunities to activate.

The cracking time of the highest difficulty is enough for you to get the 60+40+20 or 60+60 options. Please think about what to take in advance before starting to click. Once the cracking starts, the enemy will not wait for you.

The cracking method that does not waste time is as follows:

- First, click an option at random, and then cancel it immediately (if it is the 20-second option you want, you can choose not cancel it), and observe which circuit the enemy is locking.
- Keep cracking the circuit that the enemy is locking (the enemy locks 60 seconds, and our cracking takes 30 seconds, which is just the right time); if the circuit that the enemy is locking has been cracked, just crack another circuit.
- Crack all circuits first, and then click options. The time must be connected. You can click on the next option you want when the previous option is about to be completed.

### Offensive phase: Free choice

There are many choices in the offensive phase: Eye of Fate + Super Luck? Let the ally send the prism tanks to you, and then accumulate a bunch of prisms to push forward? The Eye of Fate flies to the upper right corner to meet up with the ally? Use the engineers provided by the ally to capture the enemy's production buildings? The Eye of Fate controls a bunch of Floating Discs to form an air fleet? Even, airdrop and accumulate brutes to smash the enemy? All are possible! After helping the ally in the upper right corner to advance to the middle of the map, you can even leave your hands on the keyboard and hang up to watch the ally fight. The ally will really complete all the objectives in the end.

Note: After obtaining paratrooper support, you need to disciplinely airdrop a wave of paratroopers to the ally first to prevent the ally from being in danger in the early stage.

No matter which clearance route you choose, you should destroy at least one enemy Psychic Dominator as soon as possible. If the enemy always has two mind controllers, it will not be good for accumulation of our troops and the development of allies.

### Summary: This mission is actually more like a fun mission, but the attemtping to complete this mission quickly will significantly increase the risk of the Eye of Fate being in danger. It depends on how you choose.

## SR 13 - Star Fall

<div class="six-axis" width=250 height=250 axis_value="4,2,3,4,4,5" axis_color="#FFCC33" axis_border_color="#FF9900"></div>

This is a mission with special mechanism. When using the powerful Theia satellite to advance, the battlefield vision will also be severely limited. Once the vision problem is solved, you can use the satellite cannon to slaughter the entire map.

This mission unlocks the advanced defense building **Spiritual Suppression Tower**: With itself as the center, it causes damage to enemy ground and air units within a radius of 10. Spiritual Suppression Tower is almost only suitable for dealing with low-health unit spams, such as Rocketeers and Storm Choppers, and has limited effect on units with more health. In addition, its range of 10 is completely useless against prism tanks. On some low-end computers, if there are many Spiritual Suppression towers on the screen, it will be a bit stuck due to the animation...

The mechanism of the Theia Satellite Cannon is very simple: you can move the indicator of the Theia Satellite Cannon, and anything near the center of the indicator will receive huge damage (more than 20 times that of the mission of US 07 - Injection). However, the vision will also limit the indicator of the satellite cannon: once the mark enters the shrouded area, it cannot be operated at all (although it is still outputting), and a unit must be nearby to provide its vision to continue to operate.

### Capture the first satellite communication station: advance carefully

Rynderack can easily take down the first satellite communication station with the help of the Apocalypse Tank to hold the line, V3 to blow up buildings, infantry to garrison buildings, and Tesla troops to energize the tower. If you really think V3 is too difficult to use, you can use the Psychic Commando to control several Prism Tanks in the lower right corner.

At this point, capturing the oil derick, construction yard or barracks will cause the enemy to start the self-destruction countdown of the satellite communication station. Don't rush to capture it before cleaning up the surroundings. However, after clearing the troops near the satellite communication station, it is recommended to use engineers to capture the construction yard first, develop for a few minutes, delay some time, and then capture the satellite communication station, so as to gain valuable operating time.

Don't try to rush to the upper left corner. The enemy tower array in the upper left corner has no vision and is very tight, and approaching will also trigger the self-destruction countdown. This part should be solved with satellite cannons after obtaining it.

### Initial home defense: vision has a great impact

Due to the special mechanism of this mission, the map will be fully shouded before destroying all gap generators. Lack of vision has a huge impact on the initial home defense, which makes it difficult for you to pre-judge the direction of the enemy's troops.

The pink Allied base directly above mainly produces Black Eagles, Hammer of Freedom, Prism Tanks, Mirage Tanks, and IFVs for attack. If fixed air defense is used, it is easy to be damaged or even broken through. It is recommended to use Floating Discs to cooperate with other troops for mobile defense. In particular, it is necessary to pay attention to the movements of the enemy's prism tank clusters, and use Floating Discs or Masterminds to intercept them in time to prevent the base from being blown up.

The purple Allied base on the left mainly produces Storm Choppers, rocket soldiers, Saratoga gunships, robot tanks, and tank destroyers for attack. It is recommended to use tower arrays for defense. You can use the newly added mind suppression towers and put Soviet tanks in the tank bunkers for defense.

### Conservative attack: step by step

The conservative attack mainly develops to the left through Tower Rush: continuously extend the tower array forward, and finally accumulate 3 satellite cannons to eliminate the enemy in one fell swoop.

The satellite cannons can repeatedly wander around the edge of our controlled area, harras enemy's defense for free, and advance forward without damage.

The enemy's air force is strong. When using tanks to attack, it must be kept under the protection of our air defense, preferably a Floating Disc that has the highest damage to gunships. However, for the enemy's Rocketeers + Storm Choppers, you still need a mind suppression tower or a tank bunker with flak track as cover.

Of course, there is also the most conservative way of playing, which is to stay at home and spam Floating Discs, accumulate a lot of them and then break out... (Is it too conservative?)

### Aggressive attack: one Siege Chopper fights two brutal enemies

The aggressive attack method requires using satellite cannons to destroy the production capacity of one enemy in the early stage, usually the pink Allied above.

Use the Siege Chopper sent at the beginning to explore the field of vision around the enemy base, and then use the satellite gun to cut in and pass through the enemy base, destroying everything on the path. Repeat this several times, and you can paralyze the pink production capacity. The Siege Chopper does not need to fight with the enemy, it only needs to provide vision, so a small number can do it. If the Siege Chopper is unfortunately all gone, you can also produce some Floating Discs to complete this operation.

After defeating the pink Allied, the defensive pressure drops sharply, and you can attack easily.

### Ending: Discover and destroy

Once the gap generators are destroyed, the satellite cannon will become a sure kill, and the enemy cannot impose any restrictions on it, and can only be destroyed. Therefore, there is no difficulty in the second half, you can achieve "discover and destroy" for all enemies, which is purely for fun.

### Summary: For this mission, vision is everything. Use air units to obtain vision, and with satellite cannons, you can launch an attack with very few units.

## SR Final - Way to Immortal

<div class="six-axis" width=250 height=250 axis_value="6,2,5,3,5,4" axis_color="#FFCC33" axis_border_color="#FF9900"></div>

This mission is a multi-line defense mission. Didn't you have a psychological trauma from the Iron Bastion (Part B)? But it doesn't matter. In this mission, there is an ally at each intersection to help us do all the trivial things. We only need to stay in the center and support various places. We don't need to do everything ourselves.

### Initial advancement: Nothing can stop this offense

4 Iron Curtain devices + 2 nuclear missiles are already a very outrageous combination, not to mention the elite Lasher Light tanks that is immune to mind-control and the extremely strengthened test subject-Delta. If it is really difficult to advance, you can slow down the pace and wait for the cooldown of the Iron Curtain. If there is no Iron Curtain, don't rush.

Magnatrons, Chaos Troops, Neuro Assault Vehicles and Floating Discs can pose a threat to our units. Just click them first, or use the Iron Curtain to kill them.

### Ally Division of Labor: Barrel Effect

Every ally in this mission has an important purpose. The following is a brief description of the division of labor of each ally:

- <span style="color:#b85600">**AnLei (China, brown)**</span>: The base is located in the lower left of the core, a pressure-resistant position, facing the enemy's main ground force attack.
- <span style="color:#6ea1e8">**Carville (USA, light blue)**</span>: The base is located directly above the core, facing the enemy's land attack mainly composed of siege units + anti-aircraft vehicles. Bonuses provided: Carville's air command will provide you with paratrooper support (unavailable before joining Rynderack); Carville will share the effects of spy satellites (gain full map vision) and ore purifier (increase mining income by 20%) with you. Carville will produce a large number of Saratoga gunships to provide bombing support for various fronts.
- <span style="color:#ffe69a">**Ito Jose (Japan, yellow)**</span>: The base is located at the lower right of the core, facing the enemy's attack mainly composed of amphibious units + landing troops + airborne troops. Ito Jose will produce a large number of Harriers to provide bombing support for various fronts.
- <span style="color:#0ac359">**Wellington (EU, green)**</span>: Enter the field at the second phase, more comfortable, and the base is located directly below the core. Bonus provided: After Wellington deploys the Chronosphere, it will randomly send you EU ground units for reinforcement; as long as Wellington's mine exists, it will try to send you money regularly; Wellington will try to build Grand Cannons and Patriot Missiles near AnLei's base.
- <span style="color:#31dde6">**Maxwell (EU, blue-green)**</span>: Enter the field at the second phase, anti-pressure position, the base is located to the left of the core, on high ground, facing the enemy's main air force attack.

AnLei and Maxwell bear the greatest ground pressure and air pressure respectively, and the remaining allies will also provide strong support effects. The loss of any ally may lead to the collapse of the situation, so the shortcomings of the barrel must be made up.

### Reference for defensive ideas: Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea, Each Showing Their Magical Powers

All available technologies can be obtained in this mission, so there will be a lot of ideas. In addition, allies can almost hold on to the fourth spiritual amplification alone, before which you can arrange the defense line with peace of mind.

The most important unit in this mission is the **Eye of Fate**. As an epic unit, it can almost resist the attack of all enemies alone (except <span style="color:#b85600">**AnLei's**</span>), and even if the health is in danger, it can be rescued in time by using the super weapon "Super Luck". The Psychic Dominator super weapon provided by the Eye of Fate also has a very important role: use it on your own units to make the units produced by your own immune to mind control.

The four-way defense pressure is very high, and they are almost independent of each other and cannot support each other. The only way to support the front line in real time is defense towers and super weapons, so it is necessary to plan the four defense zones well. Once the defense line collapses, it will almost certainly collapse and there is no way to save it.

The pressure on <span style="color:#b85600">**AnLei's**</span> side is very high, and it is the direction of the defense line that needs to be taken care of. Try to rely on the existing defense system of the allies, and strengthen the defense of the allies by arranging control units such as Yuri Prime, Chaos Troops, and Masterminds. This route requires a large number of Floating Discs to supplement the output, especially the enemy's Masterminds need to be targeted. The Iron Curtain can also be handed over here to protect high-value units such as battle fortresses, Chaos Drones, and Masterminds.

There is a highland on the side of <span style="color:#ffe69a">**Ito Jose**</span>, which can be used to arrange defense and place a large number of units. Don't be stingy with the part below the highland, it's okay if it's all lost. All heroes, prism tanks, and paratroopers can be placed here. At the same time, some air force are also needed for contingency.

<span style="color:#31dde6">**Maxwell**</span> is an easily overlooked anti-pressure position. The health of the Kirov airship with full buffs is terrifying. But there is only enemy air force along this road, so the air defense can be maxed out.

<span style="color:#6ea1e8">**Carville's**</span> defense line faces a mess of battle fortresses and siege vehicles, and it is easy to collapse instantly in the later stage. This side is extremely lacking in control and line resistance. You can use Masterminds plus a certain amount of tower defenses to make up for his shortcomings.

### Summary: This mission has full technology and high freedom. Choose a defensive idea that suits you to complete the task.

About the 3 different endings:

- If Kasahara Akira dies, you will definitely enter the "General's Funeral" ending.
- If Kasahara Akira is not killed, and the timeline is merged in **SR 13 - Star Fall**, and - Anlei Base is not destroyed, the "Return of the Star" ending will be entered.
Otherwise, the "Peace Treaty" ending will be entered.
