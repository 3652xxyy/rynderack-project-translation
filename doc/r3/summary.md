# Rynderack Project 3: The Final Spirit - Mission Summary

![cover][cover]

## United States: Hammer of Freedom Drops

### US 01 - New World

Location: Incheon, South Korea

![us01][us01]

With our unremitting efforts, the order of the free world is being rebuilt. The source of the world's troubles, Yuri, is dead. Although Yuri's remnants are still causing trouble around the globe, it is difficult for them to make big splashes.

We have just received a report that Yuri's remnants assulted Incheon in South Korea. It will take some time for our air force and navy to rush there. Please mobilize the available army nearby to suppress it first.

Objective 1: Recapture Incheon Airport.

Objective 2: Defend Incheon Airport until reinforcements arrive.

Objective 3: Destroy the base of Yuri's remnants in Incheon.

Hint: When fighters land in the airforce command center, they will be quickly repaired.

### US 02 - Data Corruption

Location: Death Valley, Nevada, United States

![us02][us02]

We have detected an anomaly in the data transmission link in the Nevada desert. We will send a team to repair it.

Objective 1: Inspect the data transmission link in the Nevada desert.

Objective 2: Capture and protect all compute hosts.

Objective 3: Do not lose 10 data packets.

Hint: The enemy will transmit data packets between compute hosts in the order of A->B->C->D. Whenever you capture a compute host, you can intercept all the data packets in it. Data packets transmitted from compute host D will be lost.

### US Ex - Unauthorized Access

Location: Nevada Desert, United States

![usex][usex]

In US 01 - New World, use a spy to infiltrate the compute host and eliminate all enemies to enter this mission.

Objective 1: Scout the specified location.

Objective 2: Secure the unidentified wreckage until the moving crew arrive.

### US 03 - Witness

Location: Tanggu, Tianjin, China

![us03][us03]

The Yuri's remnant have assembled forces to attack the port of Tianjin and captured the Tanggu Data Center. This targeted attack was highly organized, catching the Chinese defenders off guard. In order to prevent critical intelligence from falling into enemy hands, the data center has activated the self-destruction program. But things are not yet irreparable...

The Chinese commando, Tianquan, will lead this operation to recapture the Tanggu Data Center and prevent it from self-destructing. In accordance with the Northeast Asia Mutual Defense Treaty, the Chinese army has requested air support from us. In return, if the data is successfully recovered, the Chinese government will share some of it with us.

Objective 1: Escort Tianquan to the Tanggu Data Center.

Hint: Tianquan will try his best to protect himself, but he cannot pass through the enemy alone, so use your troops to clear the way for him.

### US 04 - Destiny Rhapsody

Location: Iga, Japan

![us04][us04]

Akira Kasahara, the commander of the Japanese military of the East Asia Defense Force, lost contact with the headquarters during an operation in Iga. We will send a squad to search for him.

Objective 1: Find and protect Akira Kasahara.

Objective 2: Rendezvous with the Japanese outpost in the Iga Mountains.

Objective 3: Search and destroy all Titans under enemy control.

### US 05 - Tenshukaku

Location: Osaka, Japan

![us05][us05]

After reviewing the intelligence shared by the Chinese, Akira Kasahara proposed a plan. But he wanted to discuss with the Chinese again.

The war is already broke out all over Japan. According to our intelligence, there happens to be a Chinese defending force in Osaka. We need to join forces with them and then make plans for the next step.

Objective 1: Keep Akira Kasahara's Titan alive.

Objective 2: Destroy all Spiritual Suppression Towers.

Objective 3: Capture and protect the Chronosphere.

### US 06 - Century Elegy

Location: Brisbane, Australia

![us06][us06]

Akira Kasahara finally revealed his plan: Since the Chinese army provided us with a part of the backup code used by Tianshu to attack the Eye of Fate, we guess that this part of the code can also target more systems of Yuri's remnants, so we want to use our global satellite network to broadcast this code to the world and conduct a full-band injection attack. At that time, once their system receives this signal, it will be paralyzed.

Japan has fallen, and the northern hemisphere is no longer safe. We will choose Australia as the location to upload the code. Yuri's remnants have noticed our intentions and are mobilizing all the troops they can.

There is only one chance with this approach. We must succeed.

Objective 1: Protect at least 2 satellite communication stations.

### US 07 - Injection (Part A)

Location: Oak Ridge, United States

![us07][us07]

Our "code broadcast attack" paralyzed most of the systems hidden by the Yuri's remnant around the world. As a result, we located their core, right under our noses, in an unidentified building in Oak Ridge, United States.

Due to the electromagnetic shielding in the area, the signal broadcast attack had no effect on it. Kasahara Akira decided to use a physical carrier to carry out the code injection attack - he will drive the Titan to inject the code directly at their core building.

The unidentified building seems to be about to launch, and we don't have much time left.

Objective 1: Build a forward base and wait for Kasahara Akira to arrive.

Objective 2: Escort the Titan to the vicinity of the unidentified building.

## Psychic Rebellion - Galton's Last Wish

### SR 08 - Injection (Part B)

Location: Nome, Alaska

![sr08][sr08]

"Are you awake? Here comes our chance."

"Who am I? I don't have a name. I only have a code name "Delta".

"Due to the unstable energy transmission of the psychic network, we were able to regain our sanity and break free from the cage."

"We don't know when will the support arrives. Regardlessly, we have to escape from this laboratory first."

Objective 1: Explore the underground experimental area and find the exit.

Objective 2: Escort Rynderack to the Iron Curtain Device.

Objective 3: Clear the port and seize the amphibious transport.

Objective 4: Keep Rynderack and Delta alive.

### SR 09 - Reflector

Location: Yakutsk, Soviet Union

![sr09][sr09]

"Yuri's remnant have grown stronger in Siberia. The unprecedentedly large base, the defense strengthened by the Iron Curtain, and the Soviet Siberian Guard Corps under mind control have consolidated their absolute dominance over this vast northern region."

"The Psychic Rebels will not sit still. We want to make a big fuss here and reap the benefits."

Objective 1: Get Delta close to the Psychic Dominator.

Objective 2: Use the Psychic Dominator to destroy the Psychic Beacon.

Objective 3: Meet up with the rebel forces at the tunnel entrance.

Objective 4: Capture a Yuri construction yard and pack it into a MCV.

Objective 5: Escort the Yuri MCV to the evacuation point.

### SR 10 - Brainwave Overload

Location: Portland, USA

![sr10][sr10]

"No matter how deep behind the scenes the enemy hides, sooner or later we will have to face them.
"We have long noticed that there is a device with immense psychic energy in Portland. Recently, its energy signature is abnormal. Even the US military has noticed it, but their attack is not going well."

"Opportunities are fleeting. Once missed, they will never come back. We must intervene in this battle immediately. It may be an opportunity for us to unite the resistance front and reveal the hidden mystery."

"When the insidious and cunning means are exhausted, the truth will come out."

Objective 1: Capture the American construction yard in Portland.

Objective 2: Destroy the three compute hosts connected to the Spiritual Core.

Objective 3: Destroy the three Spiritual Suppression Towers.

Warning: "Spiritual Amplification" will make enemy stronger.

### SR 11 - Tide Watcher

Location: San Diego, USA

![sr11][sr11]

"Its name is the "Final Spirit". That is our enemy."

"Final Spirit is not a person or an object, but an AI consciousness born from the psychic network."

"Although "Final Spirit" was formed by the upload of Yuri's consciousness, it is not entirely Yuri. It is more cunning and ambitious than Yuri."

"In order to defeat it, we must unite all the forces available."

"The Chinese have noticed the threat of the "Final Spirit" and sent an expeditionary force across the Pacific."

"Final Spirit" will mobilize the controlled American garrisons on the west coast to stop them. This is what we don't want to see. We must provide assistance to the Chinese army as much as possible. "
Objective 1: Destroy two spy satellite uplinks.

Objective 2: Hold the ground until the Chinese landing operation completes.

Objective 3: Destroy the base of the Final Spirit in San Diego.

Hint: After the Chinese army lands, we will regain the MCV and funds to rebuild the base.

### SR 12 - Destiny Cadence

Location: Sebes, Romania

![sr12][sr12]

"The Psychic Rebellion and the Free European Union are still fighting together. Although Europe has always been the region most affected by Yuri and his successors, we are never defeated as long as we keep resisting."

"We once thought the Eye of Fate would become a monument that would forever sleep in the Arctic Ocean."

"But in Yuri's hometown, Romania, in this impregnable fortress, more Eyes of Fate are preparing to take off, and each of them will bring disaster to the world."

"This time, we must go deep into the tiger's den. If you want to defeat fate, you must first control fate."

Objective 1: Infiltrate the Eye of Fate with spy.

Objective 2: Crack all transmission circuits of the Eye of Fate.

Objective 3: Destroy the remaining Eyes of Fate and Psychic Dominators.

Note: Keep the Eye of Fate we captured alive.

Hint: The Eye of Fate can restore its own durability by mind-controlling enemy units.

Hint: The super weapon "Super Luck" can make the Eye of Fate recover its durability rapidly.

### SR 13 - Star Fall

Location: Kennedy Space Center, United States

![sr13][sr13]

"Freedom fighters from all over the world are heading to North America, and so are the Soviet people with revenge in their eyes. In this area where the final spirit reigns most deeply, there is bound to be a battle."

"Crossing Europe and the Atlantic, the Red Army once again set foot on the American mainland, this time as liberators."

"Since landing, we have been subjected to unusual electromagnetic interference. The communication between the squads is intermittent, and some have been lost completely."

"But we are no longer confused. If we follow our own intuition, we will definitely reach the same destination."

Objective 1: Capture or destroy all satellite communication stations, and capture at least one.

Objective 2: Destroy all gap generators in this area.

Objective 3: Destroy or capture the unidentified building.

Additional Objective: Protect the unidentified building until the timeline merge is completed.

Hint: Theia satellite attack marker cannot be moved into the shroud.

### SR Ex - The Abandoned

![srex][srex]

In SR 12 - Destiny Cadence, ensure that Ella survives to the end to enter this level.

Objective 1: Explore the underground experimental area.

Objective 2: Unlock the door to the central laboratory.

Objective 3: Defeat Sigma in the duel.

Note: Delta and Ella must be kept alive.

### SR Final - Way to Immortal

Location: Oak Ridge, United States

![sr14][sr14]

"All the enemy's conspiracies have been exposed, and the day of the final battle has come."

"The biggest omission of a perfect system must be itself. The final will attempts to be immortal in the world through distributed spiritual cores - after all, we can't destroy all of them around the world at the same time. But we can overload the spiritual core itself to blow out all its receiving terminals and cut off its connection with the real world."

"The bravest people from the free world have gathered here. Our story started with a defense, so let's end it with another."

Objective 1: Escort Delta to the meeting point.

Objective 2: Activate Spitural Amplification 8 times.

Objective 3: Defend the Spiritual Core.

Warning: "Spiritual Amplification" will make enemy stronger with each activation. Be prepared to deal with stronger enemies!
