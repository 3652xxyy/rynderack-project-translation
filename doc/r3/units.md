Relevant data and background information for most of the newly added units/buildings/superweapons can be found here.

## Allies

### Air Force Command (USA)

Attributes: Production Buildings / Airports

Factions: US, Japan (Technology Sharing)

Number of Helipads: 4

Special Effects: Provides "paratroopers" support skill; fighters parked on it can be quickly repaired.

Appearance: USA 01 - New World, and subsequent missions.

The United States has the best air force, and accordingly, it also has the best ground crew as their solid backing. Although it cannot provide direct assistance in combat, the ground crew will quickly repair these fighters during the intervals between battles and when the aircraft returns to the helipad to replenish ammunition.

### Titan

Attributes: Hero / Mech

Factions: EU, Yuri (Mind Control), Japan (Yamazaki Heavy Industries), Japan (Driven by Akira Kasahara), Final Spirit (Mind Control)

Special Effects: Its Drain Beam weapon will cause damage to enemies on the entire route and restore a large amount of their HP; in this game, the Titan is immune to confusion.

Appearance: US 04 - Destinay Rhapsody, and subsequent missions; Crates in Skirmish

A heavy combat mech named after a giant in Greek mythology. It is equipped with a number of EU experimental weapon systems, such as the Drain Beam, which can instantly absorb the target's energy and armor to repair its own armor. This gives it unparalleled sustained combat capabilities. During the battle of Nagoya, the Chinese army thwarted Yuri's mass production plan and left some of the malfunctioning Titans undestroyed. After the war, the Japanese army under the command of General Kasahara Akira was looking for them and recycling them.

### Kraken

Attributes: Hero / Suspension

Factions: EU, Yuri (Mind Control), Final Spirit (Mind Control)

HP: 4000

Weapons: Polarized Missiles (for land and water) / "Tentacle" Cluster Torpedoes (for underwater)

### Battleship

Attributes: Ship

Faction: EU

HP: 900

Range: 15 (minimum range 1)

Appearance: Not in this game

The previous generation of naval battleships. With the commissioning of aircraft carriers, battleships were swept into the garbage dump of history because of their all-round backwardness, marking the end of the "big ship and heavy artillery" era. However, in the face of Yuri's imminent threat, all weapons that can fight the enemy were activated, including these long-forgotten battleships.

### Immobilization Field

Attributes: Super Weapon

Faction: EU

Charging Time: 9 Minutes

Release Building: Origin Technology Laboratory

Appearance: Not in this game.

An experimental superweapon developed by the European Union. It uses a large-scale  immobilization field to directionally prevent all enemy mechanical power systems from functioning. This super weapon takes effect on the entire battlefield. Once released, it will immediately render all enemy buildings on the battlefield useless, tanks unable to move, and aircraft crashing immediately.

### Saratoga Gunship

Attributes: Fighter

Affiliates: United States, Japan (Technology Sharing)

HP: 250

Armor: Heavy Armor (Note: Most anti-aircraft weapons other than missiles do not do much damage to this armor)

Production requirements: Air Force Command (United States) + Allied Tank Factory

Cost: 1600

Weapon: Five-barrel rapid-fire machine gun (unlimited ammunition)

Range: 7

Appearance: United States 03 - Witness, and subsequent missions.

A ground attack aircraft with a large-capacity anti-armor machine gun. The Saratoga Gunship can provide continuous ground suppression firepower and confront light anti-aircraft vehicles head-on. Protected by heavy armor, they can lead the way, absorb a lot of damage, and provide cover for friendly air raids.

### Storm Chopper

Attribute: Helicopter

Faction: United States, Japan (Technology Sharing)

HP: 250

Production requirements: Air Force Command (United States) + Allied Tank Factory + Allied Combat Laboratory

Cost: 1450

Weapon: "Huracan" Airborne Weather Control Module

Creates a tornado, causing effective range damage to air units.
Causes high damage to small buildings such as defense towers.
Causes high damage to infantry, but has little effect on infantry in a crawling state.
When elite units continue to attack the same target, they will add more severe weather effects: thunderstorm (ground)/large tornado (air).
Range: 7

Special effect: Can land quickly through deployment commands. Cannot attack after landing, but can be repaired.

Appearance: US 04 - Destiny Rhapsody, and subsequent missions.

Advanced air-to-air helicopter, an important guarantee for the United States to dominate the sky. This high-tech helicopter is not equipped with conventional weapons, but uses a miniaturized weather control module to create tornadoes for attack - such tornadoes are usually deadly to aircraft and can also suppress infantry groups. Although meteorological weapons cannot achieve the precision of a scalpel, they can cause large-scale damage. Elite-level Storm helicopters can output greater power and create more destructive weather phenomena.

### Hammer of Freedom

Attributes: Fighter

Faction: United States

HP: 320

Armor: Light Armor

Production requirements: Air Force Command (USA) + Allied Combat Laboratory

Cost: 2400

Weapon: Five-link carpet bombing (drop 5 groups of bombs in a straight line, with 1 grid between each 2 groups, and the third group just hits the intended target)

Special effect: The enemy's ground-based anti-aircraft weapons have a its range (approximately) reduced by 2 when targeting the Hammer of Freedom.

Appearance: US 06 - Century Elegy, and subsequent missions.

Heavy carpet bomber. As the pride of the U.S. Air Force tradition, the Hammer of Freedom bomber can drop a large number of bombs at high altitudes on enemies that have lost the protection of anti-aircraft firepower, causing devastating blows.

### Sakura suicide drone

Attributes: fighter

Affiliation: Japan

HP: 100

Armor: special_2

Production requirements: Air Force Command + Control Center + Allied Combat Laboratory

Cost: 450

Weapon: Death Charge (actively crashes in the direction of the target and causes serious damage to the enemy hit)

Appearance: Abandoned unit, not in this game

With the increasing perfection of robot control technology, this kind of small drone with high technological content but low price has been deployed on a large scale in the Japanese defense forces. Any enemy force that dares to threaten the Japanese mainland will be threatened by the overwhelming drone swarm before seeing any enemy soldiers. These inconspicuous gadgets can do a lot of things on the battlefield: reconnaissance, attack, rapid response, and most importantly, without losing any valuable pilots.

### Nemesis Bomber

Attributes: Fighter

Faction: United States

Weapon: Resonance Thermal Missile

HP: 400

Production requirements: Air Force Command (United States) + Allied Combat Laboratory + (Infiltration) Yuri Combat Laboratory

Cost: 2000

Appearance: United States 01 - New World, and subsequent missions.

Due to the widespread use of psychic technology, Yuri's troops mostly use small mind-enhancing devices for brainwave communication instead of traditional radio communication. Brainwave communication may have higher security, but it can also become their fatal weakness at the right time. After interpreting the brainwave communication frequency of Yuri's remnants, we can finally send out the experimental weapon that can "delete" the enemy's troops with one click - Nemesis Bomber. The resonance thermal missiles carried by this heavy fighter can lock the enemy's brainwave frequency and release energy through resonance to burn their brains to ashes.

### Satellite Communication Station

Attribute: Building

Faction: United States, Final Spirit (Captured)

HP: 1000

Armor: Concrete

Appearance: US 06 - Century Elegy, SR 13 - Star Fall.

After obtaining part of the attack code from Tianshu, Akira Kasahara proposed a bold plan of "injecting indiscriminate codes into all similar devices left by Yuri by broadcasting carefully designed radio signals to the world at high power via satellite". And these ground communication stations that can upload a large amount of encrypted information to the Theia satellite system have become the key to the plan.

### Contaminated Robot Tank

Attributes: Vehicle/Suspended

Faction: United States

Cost: 600

Armor: Heavy Armor

HP: 180

Weapons: Radiation Focus Cannon / Virus Capsule (Alternate Attack)  / Radioactive Contamination (When Destroyed)

Range: 7

Special Effects: Amphibious; Can attack while moving; Immune to radiation, mind control, chaos, virus; Cannot attack buildings

Appearance: Easter Egg

Remote Control Robots are widely used in the research of dangerous goods, and Robot Tanks are no exception - these drones were supposed to be used for security work in the most dangerous research facilities, until they were contaminated by leaked experimental materials and transformed into the most deadly weapons. As for what these research facilities are researching, no one cares...

## Soviets

### Rynderack

Attributes: Hero / Infantry

Factions: Soviet Union, Psychic Rebellion (temporary joining)

HP: 250

Weapon: Focusing Ray Gun

Range: 9

Special effects: Immune to poison gas and radiation.

Appearances: SR 08 - Injection (Part B), SR 09 - Reflector, SR 13 - Star Fall, SR Final - Way to Immortal

Rynderack is the person in charge of the Soviet Iron Curtain Project and Yuri's most difficult enemy. Last time, Yuri's plan almost succeeded, only because Rynderack activated four Iron Curtain devices in Odessa and led the Black Sea Fleet to break through the siege, and finally drove Yuri to the Moon Base, and had to activate the time machine. Now that the timeline has been corrected and time has returned to a year ago, Yuri himself knows that Rynderack has seen all the plans in his mind.

### Tianshu

Attributes: Hero / Infantry

Faction: China

HP: 200

Weapons: Immobilization Ray (for vehicles) / Hacking (for buildings)

Range: 15 (Stagnation Ray) / 2 (Hacking)

Appearance: ???

Tianshu is a Chinese hacker agent. Because of his close relationship with the "foreign force" Rynderack and his many unauthorized actions, he is distrusted and closely monitored by his superiors. Although he does not carry firearms on a daily basis, his outstanding hacker skills make him a powerful infiltrator and destroyer on the battlefield.

### Tianquan

Attributes: Hero / Vehicle

Faction: China

HP: 250

Armor: special_2 (can be effectively damaged by both anti-infantry and anti-tank weapons)

Weapons: SVD Rifle (for infantry) / Cruise Missile Marker (for vehicles and buildings)

Number of Summons: 6 (No Rank, Veteran) / 9 (Elite)

Capacity Occupied: 2 (Hint: can be loaded into a Hind Transport Helicopter or Flak Track)

Special Effects: Once the summoned cruise missile locks on the target, Tianquan does not have to keep locking on the target; cannot be protected by the Iron Curtain, and will be killed instantly by the Iron Curtain; immune to poison gas.

Appearances: US 03 - Witness, SR 11 - Tide Watcher, SR Final - Way Immortal

Tianquan is a Chinese commando and the elder brother of Tianshu. Unlike his brother who loves hacking technology, he joined the army when he was young and has been serving in the most loyal border defense force, doing the most dangerous tasks, and he doesn't have much time to contact his brother. Tianquan usually drives a light vehicle to the forefront of the battlefield and uses the rifle in his hand to accurately shoot the enemy. Although Tianquan himself has difficulty dealing with heavy targets, he has the authority to call for tactical strikes and mark the strike position for the cruise missile array.

### Maomao

Attributes: Hero / Infantry / Non-human

Faction: China

HP: 150

Weapon: Dog Bite

Special Effect: Immune to the bites of other dogs; can automatically restore health.

### Sevastopol Fortress Cannon

Attributes: Landmark Building / Defense Building

Faction: Soviet Union

HP: 1200

Range: 25

Appearance: Not in this game.

An old cannon located in the Sevastopol Fortress in Ukraine. Although it is a very outdated weapon left over from World War II, it was reactivated when Rynderack defended Yuri's attack on the city. Every roar of it will make the whole city tremble.

### Fast Neutron Injection Device

Attributes: Landmark Building

Faction: China

HP: 1000

Appearance: Not in this game.

The core facilities of China's Mianyang Nuclear Research Center. These devices can convert depleted uranium containing uranium-238 into plutonium-239, a nuclear weapon raw material, through fast neutron proliferation reactions. Yuri has coveted these facilities for a long time, but the Chinese are determined not to let them fall into the hands of the enemy.

### Psychic Troops

Attributes: Infantry

Faction: China

HP: 100

Production requirements: Soviet Barracks + Soviet Combat Lab

Cost: 1200 (800 in SR Final - Way to Immortal)

Appearances: US 03 - Witness, SR 10 - Tide Watcher, SR Final - Way to Immortal

Although the unfair deal between China and Yuri has ended, this does not prevent the Chinese from using some of the psychic technology they have obtained to train their own psychic troops, which can be said to be "giving someone a taste of their own medicine". Although due to the imperfection of the technology, it takes more time and money, but it is enough.

### Hind Transport Helicopter

Factions: China, Soviet Union (Technology Sharing)

HP: 225

Number of passengers: 3 (Loading volume limit: 2)

Appearance: US 03 - Witness, US 05 - Tenshukaku, SR 10 - Tide Watcher, SR Final - Way to Immortal

The Soviets and Chinese use these transport helicopters to drop infantry or lift cargo across terrain. Although it is difficult to carry a large number of troops, the simple and practical performance is sufficient for small-scale maneuvers of special forces.

### Recruiting Center

Attributes: Production Building / Resource Enhancement

Faction: China

Cost: 800

Special effect: Each recruitment center increases the cost of infantry by 50%, but the infantry trained in the barracks will be trained in the recruitment center at the same time.

Quantity Limit: 3

Appearance: US 03 - Witness, US 05 - Tenshukaku, SR 10 - Tide Watcher, SR Final - Way to Immortal

China trains infantry faster by recruiting militia. With the full launch of preparations for war, the state of "everyone is a soldier" begins, and the enemies of the Republic will soon be caught in the vast ocean of people's war.

Reference data:

1 Recruitment Center: Production speed 200%, total price 150%, unit price 75%.
2 Recruitment Centers: Production speed 300%, total price 225%, unit price 75%.
3 Recruitment Centers: Production speed 400%, total price 337.5%, unit price 84.375%.

After replicating the training technology of the superpower force, the Chinese reconstructed Yuri's psychic detection technology and used it to detect the movement of Yuri's troops, especially the elusive Boomer Attack Submarine.

## Yuri

### Test Subject - Delta

Attributes: Hero / Infantry

Faction: Yuri (formerly), Psychic Rebellion

HP: 600

Weapons: Psychic Drain / Psychic Restructuring

Range: 5.25 (Psychic Drain) / [Range Attack Radius] 3.5 (Psychic Restructuring)

Special Effect: After using the main weapon "Psychic Drain" to attack, the secondary weapon "Psychic Restructuring" will be launched at its own position to restore a small amount of HP of surrounding infantry and tanks; the main weapon "Psychic Drain" can clear the collapsed slope.

Production Requirements: Yuri Barracks + Psychic Sensor + Yuri Combat Laboratory

Cost: 1500

Appearance: SR 08 - Injection (Part B), and subsequent missions

As a test subject, he was born without a name, only a number: "Delta". Yuri put a lot of effort into increasing his psychic energy, but this part of the increase was not reflected in the destructive power - instead, he could not suppress the surging power in his body and unconsciously repaired the surrounding objects. Therefore, he was regarded as a failed test subject and sealed in the Nome underground laboratory.

### Test subject - Sigma

Attributes: Hero / Infantry / Boss

Faction: Yuri (formerly), Final Spirit

HP: 13500 (boss battle)

Weapons: Small Psychic Orbs / Large Psychic Orbs / Charged Psychic Blast

Range: 11 (Small Psychic Orbs) / ∞ (Large Psychic Orbs) / [Range Attack Radius] 3.5 (Charged Psychic Blast)

Appearance: SR Ex - Abandoned

One of the only two test subjects left. We know very little about him. Test subject - Delta seems to know something about him, but once talking about this topic, he is also very secretive.

### Ella

Attributes: Hero / Infantry

Factions: Yuri (formerly), Psychic Rebellion

HP: 150

Weapons: Virus Sniper Rifle / Long-range Sniper Mode

Range: 14 (Virus Sniper Rifle) / ∞ (Long-range Sniper Mode)

Special Effects: Immune to mind control, chaos and viruses; "Long-range Sniper Mode" is only effective for the psychic Orbs summoned by the test subject-Sigma.

Appearances: SR 08 - Injection (Part 2), SR 12 - Destiny Cadence, SR Ex - Abandoned, SR Final - Way to Immortal

Elite virus sniper, one of the leaders of the Psychic Rebellion, led the cooperation between the Psychic Rebellion and the Free EU (the EU's resistance force in the Yuri-ruled area), and had a lot of dealings with General Wellington of the EU.

In the battle of Dracula Fortress, Ella sent a large number of virus snipers to ambush Yuri's retreat route, but Yuri, under the guidance of his followers, still quickly crossed the dangerous area and escaped like lightning. Since then, Ella realized the profound gap between himself and Yuri's followers, so he continued to go underground and tried to find a better leader for the Psychic Rebellion.

### Psychic Spire

Attributes: Building / Repair Factory

Faction: Final Spirit, Psychic Rebellion

Health: 1200

Repair Radius: 3.5

Special Effect: Every 10.67 game seconds, restore 50 health points of surrounding air units, regardless of enemy or friend. Provide the premise for the construction of Yuri's base vehicle.

Production Requirements: Yuri Construction Factory + Yuri Tank Factory

Cost: 1000

Appearance: US 07 - Injection (Part 1), and subsequent missions

In theory, the "Psychic Reorganization" of the test subject-Delta can become a good battlefield support force. However, the artificial brains currently produced cannot perfectly control this reorganized psychic energy - when encountering the ground, the energy wave will be strongly reflected over a large area, forming unexpected interference waves and producing destructive effects. Therefore, this psychic energy wave is only used to be exported from the top of the Psychic Spire to repair air units in an open environment.

### Yuri Statue

Attribute: Defensive Building

Faction: Yuri, Final Spirit, Psychic Rebellion

HP: 1200

Weapon: Yuri's Eye

Range: 15

Production Requirements: Yuri Construction Plant + Psychic Sensor

Cost: 2000

Factions: Final Spirit, Psychic Rebellion

HP: 1200

Weapons: Spiritual Suppression

Range: 10 (damage radius)

Production requirements: Yuri Construction Yard + Psychic Sensor + Yuri Combat Laboratory

Cost: 2000

Appearance: US 05 - Tenshukaku, and subsequent missions

This defense tower flashing with ominous electric light is more dangerous than the Psychic Tower. Although it cannot cause damage to the enemy in an instant, it can continuously release psychic energy to a large area around it, slowly eroding all enemies who dare to approach. In front of it, human wave tactics are meaningless.

### Yuri Prime

Attributes: Infantry / Amphibious

Factions: Yuri, Final Spirit, Psychic Rebellion

HP: 150

Weapons: Remote Psychic Control (for infantry and vehicles) / Powerful Psychic Blast (activated when deployed)

Range: 9 (Remote Psychic Control) / 0 (Powerful Psychic Blast)

Production requirements: Yuri Barracks + Psycho-sensor + Yuri Combat Lab

Cost: 1350

Appearance: US 01 - New World, and subsequent missions

Compared to the crude Yuri clone, Yuri Kai is a more accurate replica of Yuri's own psychic power. Although there is still a small gap from Yuri himself, they can already use psychic power to float in the air or control the enemy's mind from a longer distance.

### Chaos Troops

Attributes: Infantry

Factions: Final Spirit, Psychic Rebellion

HP: 150

Weapons: Chaos Air Jet

Range: 6.5

Production Requirements: Yuri Barracks + Psychic Sensor + Yuri Combat Lab

Cost: 700

Appearances: SR 08 - Injection (Part B), SR 10 - Brainwave Overload, and Subsequent missions

Compared to the Chaos Drone, Chaos Troops are more stable chaos makers, although they are still an unstable factor on the battlefield. In addition to causing the enemy to fall into a state of cannibalism, the poison gas sprayed by Chaos Troops can also penetrate into buildings and cause effective damage to buildings from the inside.

### Eye of Fate

Attributes: Hero / Aircraft

Factions: Yuri, Final Spirit, Psychic Rebellion

HP: 1600

Weapons: Remote Psychic Control (for infantry and vehicles, can be used against air) / Ultimate Psychic Blast (for buildings, or when deployed directly below)

Range: 9 (Remote Psychic Control) / 3 (Ultimate Psychic Blast)

Special Effects: Its weapon has 7 layers of charge, each layer of charge can be used to quickly release remote Psychic Control or Ultimate Psychic Blast, although the charge is very slow; every time it controls an enemy unit, it will gain considerable HP recovery; it can control up to 26 enemy units at the same time.

Appearances: US 04 - Destiny Rhapsody, US 06 - Century Elegy, US 07 - Injection (Part A), SR 08 - Injection (Part B), SR 12 - Destiny Cadence, Sr Final - Way to Immortal

Eye of Fate was once Yuri's real trump card, a flying Psychic Dominator. With the failure of Yuri's "Eye of Fate" plan and his death in the Arctic, the information of this decisive weapon has been sealed by various countries and only used as a top secret for the development of targeted weapons. However, God knows if there is anyone in a corner of the earth who is mass-producing this destructive behemoth.

### Super Luck

Attribute: Super Weapon

Affiliated Force: Psychic Rebellion

Charging Time: 10 Minutes

Release Source: Eye of Fate

Effect: Make the Eye of Fate enter a state of high-speed recovery of health for 30 seconds.

Appearance: SR 12 - Destiny Cadence, SR Final - Way to Immortal

Is fate just a combination of countless probabilistic events? Perhaps when the spiritual energy is strong enough, it is enough to reverse the flow of fate and burst out amazing combat power at the most critical moment. Survive, the free world still needs us!

### Compute Host

Attribute: Building

Faction: Final Spirit, United States (Captured)

HP: 1000

Appearance: US 01 - New World, and subsequent missions

The world has just discovered that these supercomputer arrays left by Yuri are spread all over the world. Before the data in them is decrypted, no one knows what kind of plan is hidden in them.

### Spiritual Core

Attribute: Building / Super Weapon

Faction: Final Spirit

HP: 2000

Appearance: US 07 - Injection, SR 10 - Brainwave Overload, SR Final - Way to Immortal

Special Effect: It can activate the super weapon "Spiritual Amplification". Each "Spiritual Amplification" will increase the HP of all friendly units in the field by 1.2, and this effect can be stacked multiple times.

Yuri's large device located at the core of Oak Ridge Base. It exudes strong psychic energy, but it is different from the dominant energy of the "Psychic Controller". No one knows who will use that device for what.

### Psychic Airdrop

Attributes: Super Weapon

Faction: Psychic Rebellion

Charging Time: 4 Minutes

Release Source: Yuri Combat Lab

Effect: Deliver 2 Psychic Commandos by parachuting.

Appearance: SR 10 - Brainwave Overload, and subsequent missions

In the midst of adversity, the Psychic Rebellion and the US Army quickly reached such a cooperation: the Psychic Rebellion provided the technology inherited from the Yuri camp to train the superpower troops, while the US Army equipped the trainees with powerful C4 explosives and sent them to the battlefield by parachuting.
