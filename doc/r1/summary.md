# Rynderack Project - Mission Summary

![cover][cover]

## Allies: The last hope of the free world

Commander, the Red Soviets have defeated our strongest and most reliable ally - the United States. Although the United States has strong military strength, it is still defeated by a secret weapon that seems to be able to completely take over people's minds. We don't have any intelligence on that weapon, but we don't have time to worry about that. The entire Europe has been rolled over by the torrent of steel. The Soviet fleet has set off from France, preparing to execute a plan code-named "Sea Lion" to cross the English Channel and attack Great Britain. To this end, the Queen convened an emergency meeting to prepare for the implementation of a defensive counterattack plan code-named "Kingfisher"...

### EU 01 - Sealion vs Kingfisher
Location: Portsmouth, Britian

![eu01][eu01]

The iron heel of the Soviet Union has trampled on the entire European continent, and Britain may be the last hope of the entire free world. Sirens finally sounded across Great Britain. We knew they were coming, but we didn't expect them to come so quickly.

Our last fortress, London Fortress, needs more time to prepare. You are responsible for delaying the attacking Soviet army in Portsmouth Harbor.

Objective 1: Keep at least one construction yard until the London Fortress is ready.

Objective 2: Continue fighting until the last drop of blood.

### EU 02 - Perfect Holiday
Location: Cannes, France

![eu02][eu02]

Our defensive operations at Portsmouth forced the Soviet Union to temporarily abandon its plan to attack Britain. This bought us some time, and we can take the opportunity to counterattack the European continent.

According to reliable sources, Soviet Prime Minister Romanov is on vacation in Cannes, France. If we could kidnap him, we might be able to get twice the result with half the effort.

Objective 1: Infiltrate and kidnap Romanov.

Objective 2: Destroy the psychic beacon controlling Romanov.

Objective 3: Let Prime Minister Romanov board the helicopter and evacuate.

Objective 4: Destroy all hostile forces in Cannes.

Hint: Although the Soviets are hostile to us, they will not attack their own Prime Minister.

### EU 03 - Code: Statesman
Location: Port Said, Egypt

![eu03][eu03]

The mastermind behind the scenes has been very clear. Yuri, who has the power of mind control, is manipulating everything behind the scenes. This careerist first deceived the Soviets, then flattened the United States, and now he is trying to occupy the entire Europe.

According to the information provided by Romanov, Yuri is transporting a batch of genetic weapons from the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean and then into Europe. We must not allow this catastrophe to happen. But we do not have any established military power in North Africa. Everything can only rely on the Allies' best agent - Tanya.

Objective 1: Destroy the genetic mutator that threatens Tanya.

Objective 2: Sink the remaining freighters in Port Said.

Objective 3: Ensure no cargo ship leave Port Said.

Objective 4: Keep Tanya alive.

### EU 04 - Skyline

Location: Giza, Egypt

![eu04][eu04]

Our successful operation in Port Said could lead to more adventurous plans in North Africa, such as recovering a secret weapon that might turn the tide of the war.

The Allied North African Army has been controlled by the psychic beacon. The Origin Technology Laboratory in Giza started the self-destruction process after detecting the psychic waves. If our strike team can arrive in time to prevent its self-destruction, we can reactivate the secret weapon in the Origin Technology Laboratory.

Objective 1: Escort the MCV close to the laboratory and clear its self-destruct command.

Objective 2: Don't let any Yuri troops get close to the laboratory.

Objective 3: Destroy all Yuri's troops in Giza.

### EU 05 - Nuclear Pacifism

Location: Brussels, Belgium

![eu05][eu05]

Yuri's troops have withdrawn from North Africa, and we can use North Africa as a base to counterattack Europe. 

We have reactivated the military base in Brussels, but Yuri has deployed nuclear weapons here, which poses a great threat to us.

Objective 1: Protect the Atomium from nuclear attack. 

Objective 2: Eliminate the nuclear threat in Brussels.

Hint: You may need to use force shield to protect the Atomium from nuclear missiles.

### EU 06 - Frozen Ocean

Location: the North Sea

![eu06][eu06]

Yuri has taken control of the entire European continent. The European Allied forces were forced to withdraw to the sea. 

Through analysis of the signals sent by the Brussels psychic beacon, we have determined that the center of the entire European psychic control network is in Odessa. If there is a Chronosphere, we can launch an attack there immediately. 

So, we need a Chronosphere.

Objective 1: Find a suitable landing place. 

Objective 2: Build and protect the Chronosphere. 

Objective 3: Eliminate the threat posed by the surrounding naval bases.

### EU Ex - Viking Fire Sacrifice

Location: Faroe Islands, North Atlantic

![euex][euex]

Through the analysis of the Brussels psychic beacon, we found that there is another psychic beacon connected to it in the North Atlantic.

We need to infiltrate that psychic beacon to determine the central location of the mind control network that spans Europe.

Objective 1: standby and protect the helicopter.

Objective 2: Use spies to infiltrate the psychic beacon.

Objective 3: Destroy the psychic beacon.

### EU 07 - Iron Bastion (Part A)

![eu07][eu07]

Location: Odessa, Ukraine

We finally arrived in Odessa. Here, the mind-controlled Soviet Iron Curtain project leader Rynderack is developing the latest technology. 

Although we don't know what that technology is, we must get it, because no matter who it falls into, it may be the final trump card.

Objective 1: Capture and protect the four Iron Curtain Device. 

Objective 2: Destroy the Psychic Amplifier before it is activated. 

Objective 3: The Soviet construction yard cannot be destroyed.

## Soviets: Rynderack Iron Curtain Project

Thank God, comrade, we were rescued from Yuri's mental enslavement by our reliable friends in the European Union. I am very grateful to them for their help regardless of past grudges. But now we need to face a more powerful enemy together. Although we also have some troops on hand, Odessa is still in danger at any time as an isolated island in the Yuri's power. Fortunately, we have Rynderack, the chief scientist in charge of the Iron Curtain project, who may be able to provide the powerful weapons we need.

### USSR 08 - Iron Bastion (Part B)

![ussr08][ussr08]

Location: Odessa, Ukraine

With the help of European allies, Soviet troops conducting Iron Curtain technology research in Odessa escaped Yuri's mind control. However, Yuri's suppression troops are arriving. Although Romanov had moved to the Black Sea to regroup his fleet, Odessa remained dangerously sieged. 

Rynderack decided to test the Iron Curtain weapons at hand first. Actual combat is the best test, right? 

Objective 1: Protect the four Iron Curtain Devices. No one can be lost. 

Objective 2: Destroy the mind-controllerd European Union forces.

### USSR 09 - Byzantine Trader

Location: Istanbul, Turkey

![ussr09][ussr09]

Due to the influence of the psychic controller, it is not advisable to stay in Odessa for long. Rynderack had led all Soviet troops that had not yet been controlled to withdraw from Odessa. 

As for where to go next, the situation is obvious: the Soviet Black Sea Fleet will attack the Turkish Istanbul Fortress with all its forces. Here, you may find the answer to what to do next.

Objective 1: Wait for the Black Sea Fleet to assemble in the Bosporus. 

Objective 2: Clear the guards around the Chronosphere. 

Objective 3: Keep Rynderack alive.

### USSR Ex - Noisy Spring

Location: Prague, Czechoslovakia

![ussrex][ussrex]

Through analysis of the Odessa Psychic Beacon, we detected a Psychic Dominator in Prague. Some EU troops are being controlled by this Psychic Dominator.

If we can rescue them, we can use their chrono technology to raid Moscow directly.

We don't have many troops in Prague, but we can give the newly improved Iron Curtain weapons a try.

Objective 1: Escort the Kirov airship and blow up the Psychic Dominator.

### USSR 10 - Cold Pole

Location: Moscow, USSR

![ussr10][ussr10]

It's time for another Red Revolution, Commander. 

The traitor of the people, the traitor who deceived everyone, Yuri, is hiding in the Kremlin. Let's see how long he can sit in this seat! 

Objective 1: Capture the Kremlin. 

Hint: In this campaign, you may build and use up to 4 Iron Curtain devices.

### USSR 11 - the Phoenix

Location: Harbin, China

![ussr11][ussr11]

Yuri escaped from the Kremlin. We don’t know where he went, but he certainly didn’t go to Europe, where our friends are everywhere. So we speculate that Yuri may have fled to the Far East, or Asia.

Just in time, we received an emergency report from Tianshu, an agent from China: He discovered a psychic beacon in Harbin. We need to go and see what's going on there.

Objective 1: Destroy the psychic beacon on Sun Island.

Objective 2: Use Tianshu to hack into the Psychic Dominator.

Objective 3: Keep Tianshu alive.

Hint: Tianshu can use immobilizing ray to make enemy vehicles unable to move, or hack into enemy buildings at close range to make them available to us.

### USSR 12 - Blossom Crisis

Location: Tokyo, Japan

![ussr12][ussr12]

Tianshu hacked into Harbin's Psychic Dominator and traced the backend control program to Tokyo. We speculate that Yuri is hiding here.

Tokyo Port is heavily guarded, and it is not very safe to attack rashly with our current military strength. But what if we could turn Tokyo Tower into a giant Tesla coil...

Objective 1: Use Tesla Troopers to magnetize Tokyo Tower.

Objective 2: Establish a base at the designated location.

Objective 3: Destroy all enemies in Tokyo Bay.

Hint: Tokyo Tower must be charged by Tesla Troopers at all times in order to be effective.

### USSR 13 - Tilai

Location: Xichang Satellite Center, China

![ussr13][ussr13]

We were deceived!! Yuri had escaped through Tokyo's Chronosphere, and at this time Yuri had escaped to the moon on a lunar landing rocket from Xichang, China. At the Xichang Satellite Launch Center, there are more moon landing rockets waiting to be launched, preparing to deliver more weapons and technology to the moon. Fortunately, Tianshu's intelligence network discovered the clues to Yuri's conspiracy.

Rynderack and Tianshu will fight side by side this time to stop Yuri's crazy plan.

Objective 1: No moon landing rocket can be launched.

Objective 2: Capture at least one rocket launch pad.

Objective 3: Rynderack and Tianshu must survive.

Hint: Destroying, occupying with Engineers, or using Tianshu to hack into the rocket launch pad will prevent the launch of rockets.

Hint: You need to capture with engineer or use Tianshu to hack at least one rocket launch pad and protect it until the mission is completed.

### USSR 14 - Master Time

Location: Oceanus Procellarum, the moon

![ussr14][ussr14]

Finally, we arrived at the last battlefield. Yuri's defense on the moon is very strong, completely at the level of a doomsday shelter. We cannot take it lightly. In addition, we also found the time technology mentioned in the Origin Technology Laboratory here. I don’t know where Yuri got it... but it’s all almost over! Take back this technology and let the traitors get their due!

Objective 1: Find a suitable location to teleport the MCV.

Objective 2: Capture the time machine.

Objective 3: Protect the time machine until the timeline is corrected.
