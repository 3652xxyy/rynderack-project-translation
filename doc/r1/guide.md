# Rynderack Project - Mission Guide

This part is a guide for clearing each level, please come back to it if you find it difficult.

It is more difficult to pass the **challenge** difficulty level. All the following hints apply to challenge difficulty. There may be better ways to play on casual and normal difficulties.

### Translator Note
- Below sections contain **spoilers** to the story. Do not read unless you have to.
- There is no guidance on how to trigger hidden missions in the original document provided by the author. I have noted the approach below based on my own gameplay and some online research.
- The difference between 3 difficulty is significant. More specifically, **challenge difficulty is designed such that the author can barely make it without saving/loading**. The author is a very experienced RA2 player. Please keep that in mind.

## EU 01 - Sealion vs Kingfisher
Difficulty: ★★★★☆

This is a defensive mission, and resources are too limited to support a stable defense. You need to find ways to delay time.

Sell ​​the shipyard at the beginning and pull all the navy to the area under the Spinnaker Tower (landmark building), which can temporarily resist the landing. Don't even think about fighting a naval battle. You can't win a naval battle on the challenge difficulty. Quickly send troops to occupy the building and resist the attack of paratroopers and landing troops. You can temporarily send tanks to guard the enemy's landing point and sink transport ships to gain experience. However, when the Dreadnought-class battleship comes, you must escape quickly (there will be 2 warnings), otherwise you will be bombed to the point where you don't even recognize your mother. The machine shop and hospital are both within the threat range of the Dreadnought-class battleships and will fall quickly. Do not try to hold on there, otherwise the losses will be huge.

The ore refiner must be produced first in the beginnging and placed near the spy satellite, which can effectively improve the financial situation. After the second MCV arrives, pull it near the spy satellite. This will be the last stronghold.

The main defense forces are Mirage tanks, SEALs, buildings with GIs, IFVs and battle fortresses. Note that enemy infantry will also seize the building. The surrounding buildings will either be occupied or blown up. Being occupied by the enemy is very troublesome. Mirage tanks must always be protected by air defense, and siege choppers can easily detect mirage tanks. The green IFV has insufficient firepower against siege choppers, so it is appropriate to use battle fortresses loaded with guardian GIs to provide firepower. It can be helpful to promote Elite IFVs, but don't rush into the pile of siege choppers just because you are an elite. After all, IFVs are fragile.

If the front line cannot be defended, it should be decisively withdrawn to the rear base, and trade space for time to continue to reorganize the defense. Don't wait for the losses to be too significant before retreating! While retreating, use the GIs obtained from selling the buildings to enter the building to slow down the enemy's attack.

Those are the hints, the rest are basic skills. Although there are hints tips, this level is still very difficult.


## EU 02 - Perfect Holiday
Difficulty: ★★☆☆☆

The first half of this mission is the infiltration phase, the middle is the survival phase, and the last is the battle phase.

In the infiltration stage, promoting of the mirage tank is very important. The most important thing is that the elite mirage tank can recover HP. You must be calm when fighting, and always remember that you are infiltrating, not demolishing! Try to damage the Soviet defenses as little as possible, and they will help you block Yuri's attack in the next phase.

There are several places where spies must be used: the first spy is sent into the Tesla Reactor near the starting position to cut off the power of the Soviet Union. The mirage tank kills the Tesla troops and then rushes over. Note that you can use spies to lure enemy dogs over and kill them safely with mirage tanks. The second spy is at the place where the psychic beacon is destroyed. If you want to achieve 0 losses, you must use a spy to cut off the power. The remaining five spies try their best to enter the Soviet ore refinery to steal funds, which is very important for the subsequent battle phase.

The survival phase begins after destroying the psychic beacon. Quickly maneuver Romanov to hide in the far left corner of the entire military base where there are two Tesla coils. It is safer there and Yuri's floating discs, tanks and virus snipers cannot threaten him. The mirage tank went down the mountain the same way it came. At this time, Yuri's tanks are attacking the Soviet defenses, using Mirage tanks to attack Yuri's tanks from the side, helping the Soviet troops as much as possible (although the Soviet troops are against us, the Soviet troops will not attack Romanov). The Mirage tank covers Romanov along the border on the map to the Soviet base on the upper left, where Romanov is absolutely safe.

Then the helicopter squad can be mobilized. When advancing, use GIs to occupy the building, and helicopters explore the path to see if there are any air defense or snipers, and then make corresponding countermeasures. Note that when the helicopter is flying among buildings, try to keep it flying along the road. Climbing buildings will affect its escape speed when encountering danger. Meet Romanov outside the Soviet base and quickly take him to the lower left corner of the map.

After evacuating Romanov, it entered the battle phase. The Soviet Union and Yuri just focus on fighting each other and rarely divide their troops to attack players. In terms of challenge difficulty, please note that the Soviet siege choppers and Yuri's Magnetron are more threatening, but the overall attack intensity is still very low, and you can develop stably and push the entire map. When attacking, remember to avoid the battle area between the Soviet army and Yuri and attack from the side, otherwise your attacking troops will be attacked from two sides and easily suffer losses. The main forces of the attack are Prism tanks, Mirage tanks (mainly against Magnetron) and battle fortresses loaded with guardian GIs (mainly against siege choppers). During the advancement process, you will encounter very fierce urban street fighting, and the number of grizzly tanks must be sufficient.

The difficulty of this level is moderate, just keep calm.


## EU 03 - Code: Statesman
Difficulty: ★★★☆☆

This is a single-soldier concurrent limited time mission. In challenge difficulty, the error margin rate is extremely low.

There is basically no difference in the enemy's attack between normal difficulty, casual difficulty and challenge difficulty. The difference lies in the time of each ship leaving port and the genetic mutator: the time limit of challenge difficulty is very tight. Don’t be in a tactical daze!

Ship 1: Quickly select Tanya and go directly to the port, ignoring the patrolling infantry, and blow up the anti-aircraft gun and repair shop (together with the tanks inside) on the roadside. Continue along the path and go down to the left, clear out the miscellaneous soldiers, blow up the sentry gun next to the gate, blow up the anti-aircraft gun next to the billboard, go down to the right and go to the port, just in time to meet up with the first cargo ship, blow it up and sink it. Then quickly go ashore, two floating discs will come to block the road and cause trouble for Tanya.

Ship 2: Clean the port area first, blow up a few anti-aircraft guns (to allow the plane to take off) and the grinder (take the money crate). Pay attention to Tanya's HP. Then go up left to find the airport. After finding the airport, take off two planes immediately to blow up the cargo ship. It just happened to hit the second ship.

After the first two ships are bombed and sunk, all the following ships can be sunk by planes at the port. As long as you keep an eye on them and keep two planes with ammo. The next major operation was to control the Tanya, with the aircraft providing fire support. Concurrent bombing of aircraft formations is the core of this level's operation.

Tanya first walked down and to the left from the airport entrance to attack the barracks. Remember to use planes to explore the path. It takes 5 planes to destroy the Tesla coil. If all planes fire bombs at the same time, computer won't have a chance to repair, then only 4 planes are needed. If Tanya's health line is unstable, the sentry gun can also be blown up by planes, requiring 3 planes at a time. After Tanya blew up the barracks, there was no longer a steady stream of soldiers on the north bank.

Tanya walked along the river bank, advancing in conjunction with the plane. Tanya blew up the bridge and sent down the four patrolling Gattling tanks on the bridge. Note that there is a virus sniper near the grinder in the lower left corner. You can avoid it or blow it up with a plane. From here, you can go down to the river, avoid the Yuri statue (which has the range of a grand cannon), and swim across the bridge to the other side. The plane blew up a house in the port where Yuri's soldiers were occupying, and then Tanya just go to the genetic mutator along the river bank. While Tanya is waiting for the plane to blow up the house, she can also blow up the anti-aircraft guns on the central dam. There is plenty of time at this stage, there are more than 8 minutes to spare with optimal unit control.

Blow up the anti-aircraft guns around the genetic mutator, then use the plane to bomb the wall and destroy the genetic mutator with Tanya. The time limit phase is over. Later, we will get a wave of airborne troops to occupy the Egyptian army's war factory, and then it will be time for infantry (Allied infantry) and tanks (Soviet tanks) to coordinate. Just pay attention to the virus sniper that threatens Tanya (challenge difficulty only). V3 is still very useful as the only long-range siege unit.

The difficulty of this level lies in the concurrency and time limit, especially the first two ships, the time is very limited.


## EU 04 - Skyline
Difficulty: ★★★☆☆

This mission is divided into three stages: escort, defense, and counterattack. This is the largest and most spectacular land battle in the entire European Union, and the difficulty can be imagined.

Starting units: 4 Grizzly tanks, 2 tank destroyer, 2 IFVs (one of them has an engineer and the other a sniper), 2 Mirage tanks, 1 Battle Fortress (2 GIs, 2 guardian GIs and 1 Chrono Legionnaire), 3 Prism Tanks.

Grizzly tanks and tank destroyers are cannon fodder, so they should be sent first when needed. For the rest, keep at least one Prism Tank, the Battle Fortress, and all IFVs.

The operation of IFV is very critical. One is to swap vehicles: after the sniper IFV becomes an elite, immediately swap the sniper IFV with the maintenance IFV (but be careful and watch for snipers around); the other is when facing the mastermind at the intersection. If you want 0 casualties, you need to switch the Chrono Legion soldiers in the battle fortress to the IFV, and immobilize the mastermind as soon as it appears. In fact, you can destroy this mastermind by simply rushing the whole army (except for the battle fortress, because the battle fortress will beat people randomly) (do not use the movement attack command, use normal attack). If you control it well, you will suffer no casualties and only damage. It can be restored quickly using repair IFV. There is no mastermind on the normal difficulty level and below, so it's much easier... Use the battle fortress to destroy the Magnetron you encounter later. After all, the battle fortress is the only one that can be attacked when it is lifted up by the Magnetron.

Of course, you can also choose not to take the mastermind route, but stick to the edge of the map and go up to break the mirage tanks. The tactic here is very routine.

After blasting your way up the slope, while the MCV is coming over, don't forget to send the IFV to explore the map and look for ores.

After completing mission objective 1, the base vehicle deployment position I recommend is in front of the big pyramid on the right side, which is equivalent to the pull forward the base. After all, the mission fails when enemy when come close to the laboratory. The error margin is relatively when deploying the MCV behind, especially when facing a floating disc. Quickly capture the oil derricks and note that there is a Mirage tank next to the two oil derricks on the left. Quickly use T2 (translator note, default tech level is referred to T1, radar/airforce command is referred to T2, battle lab is referred to T3) to spam guardian GIs and snipers, and set up a grand cannon formation. Note that the main purpose of the sniper is to prevent anti-tank units from being distracted by enemy infantry and to promote the IFV. T3 is not in a hurry. The Mirage tank suffered very heavy losses in the early stage, such is the case for most units... Although there is no need to use tank destroyers, the few provided at the beginning must be used well. Although tank destroyers is often criticized by players as useless, it is still very comfortable to beat Yuri's crispy tank.

It is also possible to pull the base vehicle back and use the two large pyramids to block Yuri's troops in a small opening, but be careful of the floating disc rushing through the blockade.

Although it is too far away from the enemy's mining area in the early stage (spies don't know where to steal it), the resources in this level are very rich, and the reserves of ores and oil derricks are enough to support building large amount of troops. In the later stage, you can steal money by finding the enemy's slave miner. A spy can steal about 10,000. Although it is not enough to reach infinite money, it is still worth the stealing.

Release it immediately after receiving the first wave of immobilization field. Here you will see the scene where the immobilization field instantly shoots down all enemy floating discs. The scope of the immobilization field is the entire map, which will cause power outages to enemy buildings, stop production, tanks cannot move (they can still attack, but they have become targets of prism tanks or grand cannons), and all aircraft will crash. Infantry will not be affected. The immobilization field has three uses: first, to shoot down a large number of enemy air forces; second, to gain more than a minute of breathing time when defending; third, to assist the attack of the Prism Tank.

It can be seen that the recommended method when attacking is to spam prism tanks. Because the immobilization field can render anything that threatens the Prism Tank useless. However, even so, the losses will still be huge, so be mentally prepared.

The difficulty in escorting in the early stage of this level lies in the coordination of the allied forces' combined arms, in the middle stage it is difficult to defend, and in the later stage it is difficult to attack the enemy.


## EU 05 - Nuclear Pacifism
Difficulty: ★★★★☆

This is a large-scale war of attrition, the largest mixed land and sea war of attrition in the European Union.

The core mechanism of this level is: shield renewal. Since the nuclear missile hits the Atomium in two bursts, it will inevitably collapse if there is nothing to protect it. In the early stage, only force field shields can be used. In the challenge difficulty, Yuri will release the third nuclear missile. At this time, remember to create a second battle laboratory for backup to ensure that even if the nuclear missile hits the battle laboratory, the force field shield is still available. Of course, you can also use the Chrono Legionnaire to temporarily lock the Atomium for emergency use, but it will cost 1,500 gold each time, so a force field shield is more cost-effective.

In the challenge difficulty, the third nuclear missile targets randomly and depends entirely on the mood of AI. It may be a construction factory, a battle laboratory, a tank factory, a naval fleet, a dolphin pod, etc., or it may be an ally. It is necessary to make full use of space and lay out the base rationally.

Allies are very powerful. They will do their best to block all enemy attack entrances with mirage tanks, battle fortresses, GIs, and guardian GIs. After taking shape, you only need to add some snipers (against Yuri's virus snipers, it is very important) and Mirage tank (for emergencies), the defense line is very strong.

Most of your early operations will be at sea. If your navy does not withstand it, the Dreadnought-class battleships will launch a direct bombardment, and Kirov airships and floating discs will not be sanctioned, the land defense line will soon collapse. The navy is vital.

Aegis cruisers need to have at least 3, which is very important whether it is attacking Kirov airships, siege choppers, floating discs or intercepting missiles of Dreadnought-class battleships.

The enemy's Dreadnought-class warships are very disgusting and will use their maximum range for bombing. Once our fleet retreats to the port, the Dreadnought-class warships will bomb the land, posing a great threat to ground defenses. It is recommended to use Aegis cruisers (rush to the front of the formation to intercept missiles) and aircraft carriers (long-range bombardment) to deal with Dreadnought-class battleships. Do not cross the bridge unprepared (unprepared crossing will alert a lot of submarines). If you want to reduce losses, you need to keep micro manage units. Either the fleet keeps moving to avoid missiles, or you can pull the Aegis cruiser to the front of the formation to intercept the missiles.

After the navy victory, you may advance. You can choose to launch a landing from the port on the far left of the map to attack the Soviet army and take over Soviet technology; or send a group of mirage tanks to seize the Belgian bank below the middle road to solve the money problem. After grabbing Soviet technology, the navy will be much easier to fight. Through naval battles, both Yuri enemies near the sea can be crippled. Not much to say.

Yuri's last base in the lower right corner can be attacked using Prism Tanks (remember to enter from the entrance above), or you can use the Harrier groups to directly blow up the nuclear missile silo.

This level is difficult to operate on both land and sea lines and cooperate with allies to defend.

### Translator Note

Destroy the psychic beacon when it's about to build to trigger the hidden mission "Viking Fire Sacarfice" instead of normal mission Frozen Ocean. You won't be able to attack the psychic beacon after it appears. You can use Harriers to force attack the ground after blowing up the silo, at the right time (there might be other ways).

## EU 06 - Frozen Ocean
Difficulty: ★★★★★

This is a large scale sea battle mission. Our position is on a small island and there is no direct land connection with the enemy. This is probably the most difficult mission in the Allies chapter.

Only the fleet can suppress the fleet! You will die if you stay on an island. In front of the enemy's aircraft carrier, there is no solid defense. You need to produce your own fleet (robot tank count as the navy) and fight the enemy fleet at sea.

The tank destroyer is surprisingly useful for destroying destroyers. You can also use grand cannons, but be aware that grand cannons cannot defend against aircraft carriers. Snipers are also very useful, and are very useful in preventing SEALs from stealing ships.

The 4 aircraft carriers at the beginning must be kept alive, as they are the main support firepower in the early stage. After building the shipyard, spam naval units. When attacking, it's navy vs navy, and unit cooperation must be indispensable: destroyers against submarines, aircraft carrier bombard ships, dolphin, rocketeers, robot tanks quickly targeting enemy aircraft carriers, and Aegis for air defense. It is recommended to attack the naval base on the right immediately after starting from battle lab. Although you cannot blow them up, you can at least suppress their fleet in the port. This can effectively reduce the pressure on your own island. Capture any enemy island to obtain sufficient ore resources.
This level has relatively high requirements for naval unit management.


## EU 07 - Iron Bastion (Part A)
Difficulty: ★★★☆☆

This is a limit time attack mission. There is plenty of time in the non-challenge difficulty, but the splash damage of the Prism Tank can easily destroy the targets that need to be protected, so save/load are needed.

The enemy's attack is almost symbolic, and the defense is easy. However, siege choppers and masterminds pose a great threat to the attacking tank troops. Remember to use battle fortresses to deal with them.

Once a wave of attacking troops is eaten up, the attack rhythm will completely collapse, and it is recommended to load files or restart.

The first wave of immobilization field can destroy or grab the Yuri base directly below. If you are not prepared, just use the immobilization field and wait for the second wave of attacks. After capturing that Yuri base, don't stop attacking. You can ignore the Yuri base on the upper left and focus on completing the mission objectives and occupying the Iron Curtain. After occupation, you don't need heavy protection, just a little attention, because the enemy is more focused on defense than offense.

The difficulty in this level lies in the attacking rhythm. Although there is plenty of time, if it is held back and the attacking troops are eaten up in waves, you may still fail over time.


## USSR 08 - Iron Bastion (Part B)
Difficulty: ★★★★★

This is a concurrent defensive task. This mission is the source of the name of the entire Rynderack Project, and is the core and climax level. The difficulty is also very discouraging...

The difficulty of this level is to guard all four iron curtains. The Iron Curtain on the left relies on civilian buildings and uses anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft vehicles to intercept UFOs; the Iron Curtain on the right also uses civilian buildings, and at the same time uses Rhino tanks to keep an eye on any Prism tanks and destroy them manually; the Iron Curtain on the south needs to rely on civilian buildings. You only needs to defend the first wave of landings, repair and garrison the bunkers. The most difficult is the Iron Curtain on the top, there is no defendable ground, and you have to withstand the most violent tank attacks.

Every large-scale attack on the top needs to be withstand by using an iron curtain. Prepare a batch of Rhino tanks and use Iron Curtain when enemy tanks rush over. Try to leave a corner for the Iron Curtain device so that it can also gain invincibility and prevent it from being destroyed in the fight. When you see where you can no longer hold on any longer, quickly drop the Iron Curtain! There is plenty of Iron Curtain! !

It is best for the new hero Rynderack to stay on the top lane and be used to clear a large number of troops. But try to put it behind the defense line. If you exposed it in the front, it will easily die from unknown AOE in the chaos of the army, or be killed by virus snipers.

At the beginning, quickly build the industrial plant, and then place barracks at the top, left and right Iron Curtains. A ore refinary can be added to the lower Iron Curtain. For defense, just build towers all the time. Those soldiers at the beginning go to the bunker under the Iron Curtain. Then the infantry quickly repairs and seizes the buildings on the left and right Iron Curtains; in war factory build some miners and some anti-aircraft vehicles, and then quickly add Rhino tanks on the road. The production line must not stop so that it can barely withstand it.

Allies will be mind-controlled shortly after the third Iron Curtain goes online. Remember to clean up the friendly forces a little before then... You can use desolator (advanced anti-allies) to quickly clean up...

After the Black Sea Fleet arrives, it will get a large number of tank landing troops and a lot of money. You can use the 4 Iron Curtains to rush through the level.

The difficulty of this level lies in concurrent operation and the use of Iron Curtain. Even though there are four Iron Curtains, this level is still the most difficult level in the entire series, without a doubt.

### Translator Note

In order to trigger the hidden mission "Noisy Spring" instead of regular mission "Byzantine Trader", use engineer to capture the psychic beacon on the top left after the defense timer is over. You probably need to prepare for it in advance (e.g., place engineers in flak track and park it near the top iron curtain) because that psychic beacon will be sold by enemy shortly after reveal. It's impossible to trigger hidden mission after the psychic beacon being sold. Capture the psychic beacon will immediately complete the mission. There is almost no enemy forces defending the psychic beacon.


## USSR 09 - Byzantine Trader
Difficulty: ★★☆☆☆

This is a landing combat survival mission. The number of troops is limited, and the losses are permanent. The longer the delay, the more disadvantageous it will be.

First use squid to entangle as many enemy fleets as possible. Don't let the squid sit idle and stalk the boat when you see it. Avoid the loss of sea scorpions and helicopters.

After Dreadnought arrives, Black Eagle jets will take off. Blow up the airport as soon as possible. At the same time, use the Sea Scorpions to defend and watch out for rocketeer stealing the ship. Keep the squid swimming to prevent enemy destroyers and aircraft carriers from approaching. Don't attack submarines rashly, as it can easily wipe out the whole army; after Dreadnought clears the airport, clean up the coastal defense cannons.

After the landing force and Kirov arrived, launch a naval attack. After landing, just play whatever you want. Don't forget that siege chppers can be deployed to transform into long-range artillery.

The core of this level is to reduce battle losses. But in most cases, enemies are out-numbered, so it's not very difficult.


## USSR 10 - Cold Pole
Difficulty: ★★★☆☆

This is a war of attrition on land.

In the early stage, you should be wary of the enemy's surprise attack from behind after 20 minutes. Prepare at least 1 Iron Curtain device, send out a few Apocalypse tanks to block the bridge, and then use the Iron Curtain when the enemy rushes over. Note that using the Iron Curtain can clear out the Terror drones from vehicles.

On the front, a defense line can be arranged with the deployed siege chopper group as the core (the enemy's mind control will not take the initiative to hit the siege choppers), and the building can be extended to the bottom of the cliff through the oil derrick, forming cross fire with the long-range artillery of the siege choppers. Take over as many nearby buildings as you can, but be careful that they will be genetic mutation the moment the building is bombed. If you have spare money, be sure to send troops to trick the AI ​​into using genetic mutations. The attack force uses a mixture of siege choppers + Tesla tanks + rhino tanks. After all, with the regeneration bonus from the Machine Shop, the tank's survivability is stronger. Once you have more tanks, you can completely ignore mind control.

When attacking, it is recommended to use a combination of Iron Curtain Rhino and Tesla (Elite) + Kirovs. After the four Iron Curtains are built, the survival time of the Iron Curtain Tank is greatly extended, and it can clean up air defense and mind control units among the chaos.

The difficulty of this level is moderate. Enemy attacks rarely involve large numbers of tanks appearing at the same time, but they are continuous.


## USSR 11 - the Phoenix
Difficulty: ★★★☆☆

This is a mixed sea and land mission with early infiltration, mid-term defense, and late-stage attack.

There is a tutorial for the new hero Tianshu at the beginning. Tianshu can disable and interfere with enemy tanks (range 15), making it difficult for them to move or fire; it can control enemy buildings across walls at close range (range 2); it cannot deal with infantry.

Note that the sentry gun at the barbed wire fence on the upper right side of the warehouse must be controlled with Tianshu to attract the rhino's firepower and destroy the barbed wire fence. The power plant on the left must be controlled and not sold, as all defensive buildings in the back that require power need it to provide power.

To deal with the Tesla coil at the bridge head, first draw firepower using conscripts entering the building. Tianshu rushed over to control it in close range, and then used it to block the Chinese patrol troops. Use Terror Drones to deal with the anti-aircraft vehicles and desolators on the other side of the bridge - note that this is the only place where Terror Drones must be used.

To destroy the psychic beacon, you need to break through from the upper left corner. Tianshu controls the Tesla coil in the upper left corner (you need to use the building to attract fire) and use it to break the wall. Then use conscripts to attack.

Next, quickly evacuate to the upper right corner to meet the reinforcements. Don't actually pay attention to the Dreadnought-class battleship next to the bridge, just rush over. Next, build your defense quickly. Pay attention to the wave of (2) Kirov airships on the lower left. You need to prepare more than 5 anti-aircraft vehicles in advance to block them. Enemy Dreadnought-class battleships can be intercepted by anti-aircraft vehicles, restricted by desolators, or destroyed by siege choppers. It is not recommended to build a navy at this time, as you will encounter submarines that are difficult to deal with.

After forming an alliance with China, it enters the counterattack stage. Quickly send out the navy and a large number of flak cannons. The Chinese army will completely withstand the pressure on the front, and there is almost no need to do anything defensively. You can send out a large number of Dreadnought-class warships to cause trouble, and directly blow up the Yuri base on the upper right. You can also send out some siege choppers to assist the Chinese allies in their land attack, and you can directly capture the Yuri base on the lower right. If you grab the technology and get the floating disc, you can really do whatever you want; if you don't get the Yuri technology, you can capture it with pure siege choppers and Kirov airships, as long as you cooperate closely with the ground forces of your allies.

The island on the upper left has three oil derricks.

The difficulty of this level is moderate. There is a bit of a trick during infiltration in the beginning. There is a slight sense of pressure in the mid-term, but there is no pressure at all in the later stage - allies are powerful!


## USSR 12 - Blossom Crisis
Difficulty: ★★★★☆

This is a naval combat mission. (Obviously there is land?)

Facing the rush of the Allies with all technology, the Soviet army was almost unable to confront directly and could only huddle behind Tokyo Tower for defense. The navy is the way to change the situation.

Defense should be based on defense towers, because the enemy will have a large number of battle fortresses loaded with guardian GIs, and tank defense will not be able to take advantage at all. Tokyo Tower is the core of defense. Several bunkers, Tesla coils, anti-aircraft guns, Apocalypse tanks, deployed siege choppers, a large number of mobilized troops (used to disperse the firepower of aircraft carriers and snipers), etc. can be placed around it to prevent Tokyo Tower from being approached. Note that the lower left side of Tokyo Tower is within the range of the enemy aircraft carrier. Unless the navy can already hold it there, do not prepare a permanent defense there.

There are two fixed drop-off points for Chronosphere, one is next to Tokyo Tower and the other is next to the shrine. Each time several fully loaded battle fortresses and Prism tanks are dropped, the threat is huge and must be defended. Note that there may be snipers in the battle fortress teleported from Chronosphere. The Tesla troops charging Tokyo Tower will need to be replenished in time. A desolator can be deployed at the entrance of the shrine to quickly destroy the light prism tanks teleported through Chronosphere.

Lightning Storm's main target is naval fleet groups, so be careful to avoid them, especially slow units such as submarines and dreadnoughts.

Use a group of Kirov airships or a group of tanks (which may require an Iron Curtain) to go around the left border of the map behind the Chronosphere and destroy it, which can greatly reduce the defensive pressure.

After the situation stabilizes, prepare a large number of submarines, Dreadnought-class battleships, and Sea Scorpions for naval battles. Just use Dreadnought-class battleships to bomb them all the way. The two allied bases are almost all within range, and those that are not within range can also be dealt with with nuclear missiles. You can choose to land on Yuri's base in the lower right corner or blow it up with Kirov.

This level is difficult to defend, but has abundant funds. The offensive phase is a mindless rush.


## USSR 13 - Tilai
Difficulty: ★★★★☆

This is a concurrent limited time mission. Low error margin, remember to save the game frequently.

Neither Rynderack nor Tianshu are heroes that can be fought alone, so great care should be taken to move together with unit groups. Rynderack can kill anti-infantry enemies while using Tianshu to control them, but it's a bit dangerous in a one-on-one fight. Also, these two heroes are very difficult to fight dogs...either use Rynderack to deal with them from a distance, or combine them with other units.

The process of this level is very clear, which is to attack each rocket launch platform in the order they are online. Principle: Don't care if the launch pad is stolen, don't care if Kirov, don't care if the tank is lost, don't care if the refinary explodes, sell what should be sold, go around what you can, and don't fight what doesn't need to be fought... Who we are? We are the Soviet Army! What is our slogan? If you have war factory, you can do it! ! !

Second launch pad: Go up the right slope and pay attention to the desolators patrolling above. Enter the town and advance slowly inside the town. Pay attention to avoid helicopters, or control the health of anti-aircraft vehicles to focus fire on helicopters. Then bypass the entry building and battle bunker, go straight to the war factory, and quickly build the miners (one if there is a refinary), anti-aircraft vehicles (keep about 3), and rhino tanks (a lot of rhinoceros tanks!!!).

The third launch pad: Send around 5 Rhinos, Rynderack will stay at the base to protect against paratroopers, and more than 2 Rhinos will stay at the base to prevent demo trucks. 3 Rhinos + 1~2 anti-aircraft vehicles + Tianshu bypassed the garrison buildings and bunkers and broke in from the lower right corner of the third launch pad. Pay attention to using Tianshu to disable Apocalypse/Magnetron, and then destroy using Rhino without any damage. Deal with Tesla troops using anti-aircraft vehicles.

The fourth launch pad: When Tianshu returns to the base, build 2 V3 rockets to clear the eyesore of the garisoned buildings. Tianshu, Rynderack, more than 2 anti-aircraft vehicles, 2 V3 rockets, and a bunch of rhinos attack upward. Tianshu took the time to occupy the airport. Make more use of Tianshu's disable ability to reduce battle losses. The Tesla coil next to the enemy's war factory can also be taken over with Tianshu.

The fifth launch pad: The two V3s still open the way and the tanks attack. When Yuri launches an attack, don't push forward and let them fight. We'll attack after the fight is over.

The sixth launch pad: 1 Hind helicopter and 1 engineer are sent out. The helicopter flies directly to the lower edge of the map and kills the 3 patrolling Yuri. The launch pad is directly occupied and then left alone.

The seventh launch pad: Send every units and capture it. The previous launch pads would be stolen or bombed in various ways. As long as you capture the last one, you can ensure the mission is completed. If the previous steps are completed successfully, there is plenty of time here.

This level is fast-paced and has low error margin. Overall difficulty is high.


## USSR 14 - Master Time
Difficulty: ★★★☆☆

Finally it’s time for the final showdown.

There are a lot of enemies in this level, but they are relatively stupid, so they can still be defeated.

The defensive phase should be based on the lunar rocket trooper + defense tower. First use the Soviet T2 to produce the lunar rocket trooper (translator note: Cosmonauts), and then use the Allied T3 to produce the immobilization field and chronospace. Use the immobilization field to gain time for development, and use the chrono iron curtain prism tanks to raid the enemy base and super weapon, and it's easy to fight.

After taken care of the superweapons, you must fight slowly. The Astronaut Fortress is also great.

Be sure to be fully prepared before occupying the time machine! Requirements: All super weapons must be built and ready, and a large number of defenses must be established around the time machine: astronaut fortress, prism tank, lunar rocket tropper, floating disc brain vehicle, etc. (if you got Yuri technology). The next attack will spawn a large number of chrono'd troops around the time machine. The frequency of spawning troops is getting faster and faster, and it's getting more and more frantic, but don't forget that you have 4 iron curtains and force shields! When there are 5 minutes left, you can basically smash down all the super weapons. Use the iron curtain to protect the time machine, and use nuclear missiles to control the situation.

Although the enemy attacks in this level are scary, the resources are very sufficient and the overall difficulty is moderate.
